Smaller projects include looking at specific aspects of design and accessibility. A recent example is a mobile application called AgeCAP (Community Assessment Program). This free application is a data-gathering tool that allows users to survey a local area by rating and describing how senior-friendly certain features of the environment are, such as restaurants, public transit, crosswalks and intersections. By building this kind of data set, researchers hope to increase awareness of accessibility challenges that may exist in the building and transportation environment. The IATSL is one of the longest-running labs conducting research on assistive technology for older adults. Thanks to its early start in this area, the IATSL’s prototypes are often frontrunners, as the lab’s researchers have been able to undertake clinical trials with users. However, a major challenge remains in finding adequate test areas to further 27 iDAPT Centre for Technology Toronto Rehab is one of Rehabilitation Research, the largest rehabilitation Transportation Toronto Rehab hospitals in North America.

As director and associate professor, Alex Mihailidis leads a research team that is exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, sensors and assistive technology. Their projects include: • Developing and testing “zero-effort technologies” that will help aging adults to return to work or remain in their homes, and reduce the need for care-givers • Help clinicians move toward a model of ambient healthcare • Develop programs for people with disabilities of all ages, from children with developmental disabilities to older adults with dementia • Improve the rehabilitation process following injury and disease 26 As a leading research lab in this field of study, the team develop and test various technology. Ideally, the IATSL also develops frameworks, guidelines and methodologies envisions having access to a “living lab” that would entail related to Universal design so that other stakeholders can a community of a hundred homes where its technologies better understand what kind of technologies are needed could be installed and studied on a longitudinal basis. As and how to develop and implement them. recruitment for this type of project is difficult, the lab continues to improve ways to field test their technology A major research area of the IATSL is the development of in real homes of older adults and collect information to smart home systems and intelligent prompting systems further their work. that will allow older adults to “age-in-place.” Such systems use artificial intelligence to learn about a person’s Looking ahead, the IATSL would like to see two trends behaviour and activities so that adaptable, timely and bolster their efforts.

Many of our technology-focused programs, such as those in computer science and software development, will cover AI concepts and applications.  To find the most relevant programs, I recommend browsing our website's program listings and using keywords like \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" or \"data science\" in the search function.  This will help you pinpoint the programs best suited to your interest in applied AI.", "error": null, "status": "success"}

Workplace emergency preparedness and planning are important in meeting this responsibility.

(2) If an employee who receives individualized workplace emergency response information requires assistance and with the employee's consent, the employer shall provide the workplace emergency response information to the person designated by the employer to provide assistance to the employee. (3) Employers shall provide the information required under this section as soon as practicable after the employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation due to the employee's disability. (4) Every employer shall review the individualized workplace emergency response information, a) when the employee moves to a different location in the organization; b) when the employee's overall accommodations needs or plans are reviewed; and c) when the employer reviews its general emergency response policies.

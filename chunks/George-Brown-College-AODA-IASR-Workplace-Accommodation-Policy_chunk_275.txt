The purpose of this document is to provide: ● A clear statement regarding the obligations and responsibilities required for a successful workplace accommodation policy at George Brown College; ● Standards for the consistent application of this policy and related processes across the college; and ● Guidance for employees, college departments, management, union representatives, and any other parties involved in the workplace accommodation process regarding their respective roles and obligations. In accordance with this policy, the college is committed to: ● Ensuring that each person with a disability will be considered individually, on a case-by-case basis, in order to determine workplace accommodation requirements; ● Achieving a culture and work environment that is supportive of employees with disabilities and promotes dignity, independence, integration, and equal opportunity; ● Ensuring compliance with all applicable legislation, collective agreement provisions and College policy; ● Establishing an efficient accommodation process that is consistent with principles of confidentiality and shared responsibility; ● Clarifying roles and accountabilities within the George Brown community for the workplace accommodation process. 2.0 SCOPE This policy applies to any George Brown college employee with a disability who may require accommodation, and to prospective employees who may require accommodation during the selection process at the college. In accordance with George Brown College’s obligations under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 11, the O. Reg. 191/11: Integrated Accessibility Standards, the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, and the college’s AODA Accessibility Policy, the college will proactively seek to reasonably accommodate employees by removing barriers that limit, restrict or prevent individuals with disabilities from participating fully and equally in the workplace. The college’s commitment extends to all employment activities: recruitment and selection, orientation, working conditions, promotion, training, performance management, career development and workforce transition. This policy is distinct from George Brown College’s Return to Work Policy which supports all employees returning to work after an injury or illness, and provides guidance to assess and support individual cases and accommodations upon their return to work.

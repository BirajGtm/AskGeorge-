a student or group of students in any situation that is inappropriate or inconsistent with the role of a College employee, for example, by getting drunk or using prohibited substances on College premises. 4.1 Conflict Resolution Support staff should: - strive actively to avoid conflict between themselves and any student - refrain from physical intervention to resolve a conflict between students. In the event of conflict initiated by a student, the employee will maintain an open, non- confrontational attitude and attempt to resolve the problem at hand; if a resolution is not possible, the support staff member should seek guidance from administrative staff. In the event of conflict between students, support staff will intervene by making verbal attempts at conciliation; if these are not successful, the employee should immediately notify the appropriate authority according to the procedural guidelines established in the College Policy on Emergencies and the College Policy on Student Discipline in Non-academic Matters.

If a support staff member is asked by anyone other than an administrator to perform functions or services that are not included in applicable support staff job descriptions, such services are to be performed solely on the employee’s own time. In the case of conflicting demands, the situation should be brought to the attention of the appropriate administrator. Support staff are urged to respect the professionalism of academic employees and fellow support staff members and to refrain from behaviour that would prevent others from fulfilling their duties, for example, by failing to order books or repair equipment.

event of default, the College’s cash accounts are insured up to $100,000 (2013 - $100,000). The College’s investment policy operates within the constraints of the investment guidelines issued by the MTCU and puts limits on the bond portfolio including portfolio composition limits, issuer type limits, bond quality limits, aggregate issuer limits, corporate sector limits and general guidelines for geographic exposure. All fixed income portfolios are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management during the year. The guidelines permit the College’s funds to be invested in bonds issued by the Government of Canada, a Canadian province or a Canadian municipality having a rating of A or better, or corporate investments having a rating of AAA (high) or better. Accounts receivable is primarily due from students, government, and other large corporations. Credit risk is mitigated by the highly diversified nature of the student population. The College measures its exposure to credit risk based on how long the amounts have been outstanding. An impairment allowance is set up based on the College’s historical experience regarding collections. The amounts outstanding at year end were as follows: Past Due Total 1 - 30 days 31 - 60 days 61 - 90 days 91 - 120 days Over 120 days Government receivable $ 2,677,240 $ 2 ,677,240 Student receivable 7,949,650 2,309,557 2 13,675 1,461,721 1,351,170 2,613,527 Other receivable 12,808,172 1 2,808,172 - - - - Gross receivable 23,435,062 1 7,794,969 2 13,675 1,461,721 1,351,170 2,613,527 Less: impairment allowances (3,842,656) - (384,238) (844,891) ( 2,613,527) There have been no significant changes from the previous year in the exposure to risk or policies, procedures and methods used to measure the risk. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of market factors. Market factors include three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and equity risk. The College’s investment policy operates within the constraints of the investment guidelines issued by the MTCU. The policy’s application is monitored by management, the investment managers and the board of governors. Diversification techniques are utilized to minimize risk. The Policy limits the investment in any one corporate issuer to a maximum of 10% of the College’s total fixed income bonds. 24 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2014 19.

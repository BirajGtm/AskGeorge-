extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the College is exposed during the period and at the balance sheet date, and how the College manages those risks. Section 3863 on the presentation for financial instruments establishes standards for presentation of financial instruments and non-financial derivatives. These changes in accounting policies, which will be adopted effective April 1, 2008, will only require additional disclosures in the financial statements. (ii) Inventories In June 2007, the CICA issued Section 3031, Inventories, replacing Section 3030, Inventories. The new Section will be applicable to financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the College will adopt the new standards for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2008. Under the new Section, inventories are required to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Section provides updated guidance on the measurement and disclosure requirements for inventories and the impact of any write-downs to net realizable value. The College is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new Section on its financial statements. 9 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2008 3.

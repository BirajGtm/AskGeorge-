The following steps outline the procedures for the development of the Notice of Intent to Articulate, the Letter of Intent, and ultimately, an articulation agreement or similar document, within the framework of George Brown Collegeâ€™s academic and operational policies. The actual process may vary depending on the details of the articulation agreement under development and whether George Brown College is the sending or receiving institution. These steps are intended to support the consistency of process and quality assurance essential to all articulation agreements signed by the College. Step 1 Notice of Intent to Articulate The George Brown College academic department receives from/makes a request to the potential partnering department/school/centre representative and begins discussions on feasibility and willingness to proceed. Appendix 2 contains a useful checklist of feasibility considerations. The Notice of Intent to Articulate (Appendix 3) documents the planning process and is a useful tracking tool for audit purposes. This sets the parameters of the partnership and determines the scope of the articulation and the nature of the more detailed work ahead. The timeframes for these discussions vary considerably based on the nature and needs of the partners. At this step, institutions should: 1.1 Identify names/credentials of the articulating programs 1.2 Determine the type of articulation sought (course to course or block-semester or year; bilateral or multilateral) 1.3 Confirm interests and priorities (the suitability- branding, positioning, future opportunities) of the partnering program/institution(s) 1.4 Conduct initial feasibility review of

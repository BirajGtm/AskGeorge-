Effective December 21, 2003, the College entered into a lease agreement in connection with its joint venture (Note 2) to lease certain facilities for an initial term of twenty (20) years, with an option to extend the lease for five (5) successive terms of twenty years each. During the period from the lease commencement date to August 31, 2014, annual lease payments under this agreement are $155,000 per annum for “grade level facilities” and $2 per square foot for “above grade premises”. Rent escalation is tied to CPI and is provided for during the period September 1, 2014 to February 29, 2024. In a prior year, the College entered into an agreement, as part of the Ontario Government Superbuild Program, with Ryerson Polytechnic University to lease additional premises at the Sally Horsfall Eaton Centre for a term of forty nine years, with related total capital lease payments over the lease period estimated at $9,966,000. These capital lease payments were paid as at March 31, 2003, from Superbuild funding, fundraising and College funds. As a result, there is no related obligation under capital lease related to this facility. 17 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2014 9.

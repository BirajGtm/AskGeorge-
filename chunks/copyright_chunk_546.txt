professor or instructor to obtain the appropriate authorization(s), in the name of George Brown College, to use copyright materials that are not covered by licensing agreements signed by the College or under provisions of the Copyright Act. It is further the responsibility of faculty to ensure that the Copyright Librarian/Consultant receives the original copy of all permissions received (please see Appendix E for permissions procedures). (e) The professor or instructors’ department is responsible for the budget and payment of all royalty fees and other costs associated with obtaining permission to copy works used by the department’s faculty and staff. (f) Where a copyright owner has authorized the use of a work, a record of the terms of the authorization must be kept by the professor or instructor. The record should include the parties to the agreement, the date of the agreement, the title of the work(s) used, the use(s) authorized, the duration of the agreement, and any condition(s). The professor or instructor will retain a copy and the original per 2.0.1.d above is to be sent to the Copyright Librarian/Consultant. (g) Sources must be indicated whenever material created by others is incorporated into teaching materials. However, simply acknowledging the source is not a substitute for obtaining any necessary authorizations from the copyright owner. (h) In addition to economic copyrights (e.g., the right to reproduce, publish, broadcast, etc.), the Act also provides authors and performers with moral rights to protect the reputation of the author/performer and the integrity of the work/performance. Using or changing a work or performance in ways that are prejudicial to the author’s / performer’s honour or reputation is an infringement of the moral rights of the author/ performer and requires the author’s / performer’s permission. This document is available in accessible format Moral rights include: (i) the right of attribution (the author’s / performer’s right to have his or her name associated with the work / performance), (ii) the right of association (the author’s / performer’s right to prevent the use of the work/performance in association with a cause or organization that would be prejudicial to the author’s/performer’s honour or reputation), and (iii) the right of integrity (the right to prevent changes to the work/performance that would be prejudicial to the author’s /performer’s honour or reputation). Unlike economic copyrights, moral rights always belong to the author/ performer. They cannot be assigned or licensed; they can only be waived, i.e., the author/performer agrees not to exercise his or her moral rights. It is very difficult to determine what an author/ performer will consider to be prejudicial to his or her reputation or honour. (i) George Brown College does not condone the use of personal websites or other non- GBC systems (including but not limited to: web-based applications, environments or technologies, particularly communication or collaboration, social networking, and social media tools or sites) for the purposes of communicating infringing copies of copyright protected works to students or other members of the College community in support of any academic, administrative or recreational activity. 2.0.2 Single copies made for research, private study, criticism,

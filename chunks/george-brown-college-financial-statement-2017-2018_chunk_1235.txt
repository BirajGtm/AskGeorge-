was calculated using a discount rate 2.0% (2017 – 1.7%). (b) Hospital and other medical Hospital and other medical costs were assumed to increase at 4.0% per annum (2017 – 4.0%). Medical premium increases were assumed to increase at 6.8% per annum in 2014 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.0% in 2034. (c) Drug costs Drug costs increases were assumed to increase at a rate of 8.0% per annum in 2018 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.0% in 2034. (d) Dental costs Dental costs were assumed to increase at 4.0% per annum (2017 – 4.0%). Compensated absences Vesting Sick Leave The College has provided for vesting sick leave benefits during the year. Eligible employees, after 10 years of service, are entitled to receive 50% of their accumulated sick leave credit on termination or retirement to a maximum of 6 months’ salary. The program to accumulate sick leave credits ceased for employees hired after March 31, 1991. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council. 19 The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology Notes to Financial Statements (expressed in thousands of dollars) March 31, 2018 8. Post-Employment Benefits and Compensated Absences (continued) Non-Vesting Sick Leave The College allocates to certain employee groups a specified number of days each year for use as paid absences in the event of illness or injury. These days do not vest and are available immediately. Employees are permitted to accumulate their unused allocation each year, up to the allowable maximum provided in their employment agreements. Accumulated days may be used in future years to the extent that the employees’ illness or injury exceeds the current year’s allocation of days. Sick days are paid out at the salary in effect at the time of usage. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council. The assumptions used in the valuation of vesting and non-vesting sick leaves are the College's best estimates of expected rates of: 2018 2017 Wage and salary escalation Academic 1.5% - 2.0% 1.5% - 1.8% Support 0.5% - 1.5% 0.5% - 1.5% Discount rate used to calculate: Present value of future benefits 2.6% 2.0% 2018 period expense 2.0% 1.7% The probability that the employee will use more sick days than the annual accrual and the excess number of sick days used are within ranges of 0% to 23.7% and 0 to 48 days respectively for age groups ranging from 20 and under to 65 and over in bands of 5 years. 20 The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology Notes to Financial Statements (expressed in thousands of dollars) March 31, 2018 9.

and conserving resources. As per the requirements of Reg. 397/11, this Energy CDM Plan outlines goals, measures and expected results in terms of energy efficiency, conservation and demand management. As the College continues to grow, both in terms of student population and occupancy in existing buildings, George Brown is also growing in terms of its overall building footprint with an additional 175,000 square foot of building to come on line with the addition of a new student residence in September 2016. The 2014-2019 Energy CDM Plan is an important component of the College’s Green Plan which commits George Brown College to reduce the College’s ecological footprint, to engage and educate the College community in conservation and environmental stewardship practices and to use the College campuses as learning laboratories.

To achieve a 2% reduction in total energy consumption associated with our 2012 building portfolio. 2. Maintain or reduce the Energy Intensity on a per student basis (ekWh/FTE) 3. Meet LEED Gold Energy standard requirements of all new construction built by George Brown College. The College has identified four types of measures on which this Energy CDM plan is based: Technical, Organizational, Behavioural and Educational; a combination of these measures will be required to achieve College’s energy conservation goals. Technical and physical plant measures will be important to reduce energy consumption in College buildings. Three of these measures relate to ways that the College can work as an institution to build a culture of conservation through policies and operational measures; creating opportunities for the College community and individuals to learn about, contribute to and participate in energy conserving and demand management activities; and finally, to educate students in practical and hands-on projects about the mechanics and real world applications of energy efficiency improvements and retrofits. Technical Measures: George Brown College will focus on achieving the Energy CDM goals by completing energy audits, upgrading equipment with new technology and by looking at processes to maximize the energy efficiency in key areas of the College. Organizational Measures Specify and install energy efficient equipment on any new renovation project or equipment replacement project. Investigate possible corporate policies to support demand reduction measures for peak load shedding and to reduce plug load in buildings.

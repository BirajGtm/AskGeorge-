George Brown College Promotion and Progression Policy September 2019 DEFINITIONS This section includes an explanation of terms and abbreviations used within this document. Word/Term Definition Academic Academic standing is a statement of a student’s overall academic performance by Standing term. It is calculated at the end of each term for every student. Academic standing is determined by the term and program grade point averages as well as the student’s academic standing in the previous term. Honours Standing: A student is in ‘honours’ standing for any given term when they achieve a term grade point average (TGPA) equal to or above 3.50 (certificate, diploma, or advanced diploma program) or 3.70 (degree program). Good Standing: A student is in ‘good standing’ for any given term when they pass all courses and have a TGPA equal to or above 1.70 (for certificate or diploma programs) and 2.30 (for degree programs). Probationary Standing: A student is in ‘probationary’ standing for any given term if they failed one or more courses or obtained a TGPA of less than 1.70 (certificate or diploma program) or 2.30 (degree program) and were given permission by their Promotion Committee to continue in the program. A student is also in ‘probationary’ standing if they have transferred to another program at the college after a failed term. Removed from Program: A student is ‘removed from program’ if in the previous term they obtained a TGPA of less than 1.70 (certificate or diploma program) and 2.30 (degree program) and were not given permission by their Promotion Committee to continue in the program. A student will also be removed if they fail two consecutive terms in their program (i.e. if they fail to meet the conditions of their Probationary Contract).

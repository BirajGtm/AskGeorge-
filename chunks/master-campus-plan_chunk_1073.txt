This can afford new opportunities to grow with the City as intensification occurs. The College should seek co-development opportunities that leverage ongoing construction activity to provide new space in partnership with developers and other institutions. Allow Industry to Drive Growth & Positioning: As the City continues to intensify and aims to re-shore manufacturing and other industries to the downtown core, GBC should align with these initiatives. This can drive spatial growth, academic programming and enhance partnerships as George Brown College continues to supply skilled labour to meet the demands of a changing economy. Utilize City Assets & Amenities to Offset Spatial Needs: Enhancing partnerships within the City to leverage existing assets and amenities (cultural, social, athletic, etc.) can assist George Brown College to balance its spatial needs and enhance the student experience. As an urban College there are opportunities to engage local businesses and city-owned facilities to provide access to informal work spaces, athletic facilities, etc. THOUGHT David Crombie - Chair of the Waterfront Ken Greenberg - Greenberg Consultants Regeneration Trust, Former Mayor of Toronto Lorne Braithwaite - CEO, Build Toronto Hunter Tura - CEO, Bruce Mau Design Paul Rowan - Co-Founder, Umbra LEADERS Joe Berridge - Partner, Urban Strategies Mark Guslits - Principal, Mark Guslits & John Campbell -

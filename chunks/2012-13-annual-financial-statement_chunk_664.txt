FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (continued) Statement of Operations for the year-ended March 31, 2012 Pre-changeover Sub-note Canadian GAAP Adjustments PSAB Expenses Salaries and benefits (i), (ii), (iii) $ 163,881,603 $ (933,855) $ 162,947,748 Excess of revenue over expenses (i), (ii), (iii) $ 23,922,397 $ 933,855 $ 24,856,252 Statement of Cash Flows for the year-ended March 31, 2012 The transition to PSAB for Government NPOs had no impact on total operating or financing activities on the statement of cash flows. The change in excess of revenues over expenses for year-ended March 31, 2012 has been offset by adjustments to operating activities. The transition to PSAB for Government NPOs resulted in the reclassification of cash receipts and outflows relating to the acquisition of tangible capital assets from investing activities to capital activities. The capital section of the statement of cash flows did not exist prior to the transition to PSAB for Government NPOs. Explanations for Adjustments to PSAB for Government NPOs (i) Non-vesting Sick Leave PSAB for Government NPOs requires the recognition of a liability for sick leave benefits that accumulate, but do not vest, which was not required under pre- changeover GAAP. As a result, the College has recognized a liability and charge to net assets as described in the tables above. (ii) Amortization of Actuarial Gains/Losses As discussed in Note 2 – First Time Adoption of Public Sector Accounting Standards, Optional Exemptions, the College has elected to recognize actuarial gains and losses at the date of transition to PSAB for Government NPOs directly in net assets. As a result, the College has recognized an increased liability and a charge to net assets as described in the tables above. 14 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2013 2. FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (continued) (iii) Discount Rate Used to Calculate Post-Employment Benefits and Compensated Absences Liabilities PSAB for Government NPOs requires these liabilities to be calculated with a discount rate that is equal to either the College’s rate of borrowing or the rate of return on the plan assets. Pre-changeover GAAP required the discount rate to be equal to the yield on high quality corporate bonds. The College has chosen to discount these liabilities using its internal rate of borrowing. The change in the discount rate resulted in changes to the related liabilities and charges to net income as described in the tables above. 3.

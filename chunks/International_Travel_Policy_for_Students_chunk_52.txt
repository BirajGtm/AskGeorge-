Students involved in an international activity must be advised of the known and reasonable foreseeable risks inherent in the activity, and they acknowledge that they consent to the assumption of these risks. All students must complete in full, sign and date the following international mobility forms: a) Release of Liability, Waiver of Claims, Assumption of Risks and Indemnity Agreement b) Agreement of Participation c) Attestation of Good Health d) Emergency Contacts Other forms may be developed specifically to meet the needs of individual international activities, following consultation with the College Legal Counsel. These forms are posted on Insite http://insite/international_education/default.asp. 6.3 Liability Insurance The purpose of liability insurance is to protect against lawsuits arising from some accidental or untended occurrence affecting someone else’s person or property. The College has in place “worldwide territory” liability insurance coverage for student placements (study and work abroad). However, the worldwide territory coverage excludes some high-risk countries [e.g. Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Belarus, Democratic Republic of Congo, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Liberia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Myanmar, North Korea, Outer Mongolia, Romania, Rwanda, Serbia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tibet, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe, etc.]. The International Centre in collaboration with the Financial Services Department will verify that each international activity complies with the Risk Ratings System as outlined in Section 4, as well as ensures that the country is not excluded from the College’s annual insurance policy coverage. Any insurance changes and updates can be found on Insite. ________________ Reviewed and Approved: Board of Governors June 10, 2009

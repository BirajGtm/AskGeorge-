2.5 Signing, communication and retention of the Letter of Intent as required by GBC program department and the partnering institution Step 3 Memorandum of Understanding 3.1 Determine Transfer Credits and Develop Program Maps The most important component of any articulation agreement is equivalency determination and the program mapping which defines the new opportunities provided by the articulated program pathways. The process requires dialogue and collaboration between the program partners to ensure pertinent information for program development, determination of transfer credit/equivalency and gap analysis is available, complete and current. As a sending college, George Brown supplies course outlines and program maps for review by the receiving institution to determine which courses will be considered equivalent in content and granted transfer credit. As a receiving institution, George Brown evaluates the course outlines and program maps of the sending partner. In each case, the appropriate program chair/director will identify, assign and resource faculty to provide program materials, clarify delivery and assessment, determine equivalencies and develop articulating program maps which define the new course of study. Considerations for new pathway development should include: 3.1.1 A description of courses eligible for transfer credit 3.1.2 The maximum/total number of transfer credits allowed 3.1.3 The grade requirements for transfer credit courses 3.1.4 A listing of all course requirements for pathway program completion, including any additional courses such as ‘reach back’ courses or an additional ‘bridge’ semester. 3.1.5 Any work placement/field/co-op requirements in the articulated program of study 3.1.6 Prior Learning Assessment (PLAR) for advanced standing if applicable and how students can apply for this method of credit 3.1.7 General Education/Liberal Arts requirements 3.1.8 A statement outlining the process for proposed changes to curriculum, delivery or other apects of the articulated program 3.1.9 GPA requirements for graduation Articulation Agreement Policy 3.1.10 A statement recognizing the academic and student life needs/challenges of transfer students 3.1.11 Opportunities/mechanisms/systems to track transfer-student success 3.2 Determine Program Eligibility, Admissions Criteria and Conditions of Transfer List the conditions for admission into the articulated program pathway. These will be determined by the receiving institution(s). 3.2.1 Determine the start and duration dates for the new program pathway 3.2.2 Set the entrance GPA- minimum required 3.2.3 Develop a statement of good standing (all courses of sending program completed) 3.2.4 Define the student cohorts eligible to participate in the articulated pathway 3.2.5 Ensure clarity and accessibility of information related to transfer credits granted and the remaining course requirements for successful completion of the articulated credential 3.2.6 Define the maximum time frames allowed for completion of the articulated credential 3.2.7 Provide details of additional admission requirements such as portfolio, interview, audition, or other specifics such as space availability, as applied to the programs under consideration 3.2.8 Include a process for review and appeal of denied transfer credits 3.2.9 Provide a completion/fair exit strategy and accommodation of enrolled students, should the parties decide to terminate the agreement 3.3 Define the Guidelines for the Implementation and Maintenance of the Articulation Agreement Details of implementation and maintenance must include: 3.3.1 Terms relating to the length of the agreement 3.3.2 Date of signing and dates

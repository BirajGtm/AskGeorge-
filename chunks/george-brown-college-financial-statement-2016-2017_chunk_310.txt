The financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards for government not-for-profit organizations, including the 4200 series of standards, as issued by the Public Sector Accounting Board (â€œPSAB for Government NPOs"). When alternative accounting methods exist, management has chosen those it deems most appropriate in the circumstances. Financial statements are not precise since they include certain amounts based on estimates and judgements. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis in order to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. The College maintains systems of internal accounting and administrative controls of high quality, consistent with reasonable cost. Such systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is relevant, reliable and accurate and that the College's assets are appropriately accounted for and adequately safeguarded. The Board of Governors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Governors and meets regularly with management, as well as the external auditors, to discuss internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and financial reporting issues, to satisfy itself that each party is properly discharging its responsibilities, and to review the financial statements and the external auditor's report. The Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration when approving the financial statements. The Committee also considers, for review and approval by the Board, the engagement or re-appointment of the external auditors. The financial statements have been audited by BDO Canada LLP, the external auditors in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, on behalf of the Board. BDO Canada LLP has full and free access to the Audit Committee.

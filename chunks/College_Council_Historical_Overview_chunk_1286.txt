to advise the president on matters of importance to students and staff.”v Today, all Ontario colleges have advisory councils that address a wide range of academic and operating issues that affect students and staff. Postsecondary education is changing rapidly as a result of globalization, student mobility, private-public partnerships in research and commercialization, the expansion of technology, and e-learning. As a result, college councils are addressing new and increasingly complex academic and operating issues that affect students and staff. They can play a key role as a strong internal voice from the college community to the college president to help inform decisions by senior management and the Board of Governors.

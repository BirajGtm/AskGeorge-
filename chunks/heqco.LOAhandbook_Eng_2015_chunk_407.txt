the competencies in the transition process from lim ited-term to permanent positions. There is an extensive program2 to support faculty in developing and demonstrating the Essential Competencies. The competencies include learning-centred methods for teaching and assessing, fostering institution-wide outcomes and student career development skills, and a commitment to professional and scholarly work in teaching and learning. Notably, there is a specific competency for Outcomes-based Practice, including the capability to “use evidence of student learning to review and improve courses and programs”.3 There are five workshop courses specific to program assessment.4 Examples of Program Assessment and Improvement Plans: Valencia’s Institutional Assessment Office has an online library5 with numerous examples of how programs have assessed specific student learning outcomes and the resulting improvements. The example programs include dance, dental hygiene, emergency medical services, film production, graphics technology and nursing. The college also maintains extensive repositories of assessment rubrics adapted by various programs,6 data collection instruments and samples,7 and resources for institutional program outcomes such as interpersonal communication8 and ethical responsibility.9 1 http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/docs/pubs/AspenPrize021312.pdf p. 7-8 2 http://valenciacollege.edu/faculty/development/ 3 http://valenciacollege.edu/faculty/development/programs/tla/Candidate/documents/EssentialCompetenciesCurrentrevised9-11.pdf p. 3 4 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/saicc/FacultyWorkshops.cfm 5 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/LOA/PlanLibrary.cfm 6 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/LOA/RubricLibrary.cfm 7 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/LOA/DataLibrary.cfm 8 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/loa/ResourcesInterpersonalPLO.cfm 9 http://valenciacollege.edu/academic-affairs/institutional-effectiveness-planning/institutional-assessment/loa/ResourcesEthicalResponsibilityPLO.cfm 51 YTICAPAC LANOITUTITSNI GNIPOLEVED — 3 NOITCES 3.2 AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT CURRICULUM-EMBEDDED ASSESSMENT Initial movements in the program-level assessment of learning outcomes tried to separate the assessment from regular course assessment through standardized tests. Standardized assessment measures are often isolated from both instructors and the programmatic curriculum and do not encourage faculty involvement or facilitate significant improvement of teaching and learning (Rhodes, 2012). They require additional work from students and their value (to the student) is often difficult to justify. Additionally, there is increasing concern that general standardized assessment does not accurately assess learning that is contextualized within a discipline (Barrie et al., 2012). Curriculum-embedded and faculty-administered approaches to assessment align program- level learning outcomes with already existing course-level learning outcomes and integrate assessment activities into course requirements (Cummings, Maddux & Richmond, 2008). This embedded approach has the added benefit that assessment occurs within the disciplinary context. Assessment therefore takes place alongside and is aligned with teaching and learning activities. This integrated approach holds the following advantages: 1. Directly engaged faculty Curriculum-embedded assessment instruments place assessment and subsequent improvement of teaching and learning directly in the hands of instructors (Garretson & Golson, 2005). Faculty take central roles in developing and implementing assessment within courses; subsequently, data acquired from such assessment instruments are tailored to instructors and address teaching and learning specific to instructors and courses. 52 YTICAPAC LANOITUTITSNI GNIPOLEVED — 3 NOITCES 2. Motivated students Traditional, standardized assessments take place outside of the teaching and learning environment and are therefore not only isolated from the curriculum but hold little consequences for students. Curriculum-embedded assessment instruments, on the other hand, evaluate artefacts that students produce as a direct result of faculty teaching within the classroom or online. Students are therefore more motivated to perform well in these assessment tasks as they are already integrated into existing course activities (Cummings et al., 2008; Rhodes, 2012). 3.

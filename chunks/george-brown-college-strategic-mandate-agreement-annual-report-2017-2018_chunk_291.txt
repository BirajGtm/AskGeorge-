This helps us maintain a steady stream of more than 9,000 work-ready graduates per year and high employer satisfaction rates that keep Ontario’s economic engine running. Exceptional learning opportunities abound, from our Food Innovation Research Studio (FIRSt) to our Fashion Exchange. We also continue to form unique international partnerships with leading educational institutions. The prospect of studying fashion in Italy, baking in France or design in Ireland is exciting and provides great competitive advantage to our students as they enter the workforce. Our next development project, The Arbour (slated to begin construction in 2021) will be Ontario’s first institutional tall wood building. It will serve as a living lab and will be home to the Mass Timber Institute, so we can share our research and learnings from sustainable building practices.

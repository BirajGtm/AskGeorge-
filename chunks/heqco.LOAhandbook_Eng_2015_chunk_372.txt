programs are constructively aligned to enable the use of course-embedded Context: “In 2009, Carnegie Mellon University [CMU] began a university- assessments. wide initiative to have each degree- When a program’s courses are adequately aligned with overall program-level learning granting program systematically document their outcomes and outcomes, it becomes possible to use course-embedded assessments to evaluate learning assessment processes. This initiative across the curriculum. Key course-embedded assessments can be selected that best was directly tied to the Curriculum Review and Revision process… demonstrate student learning progress in relation to the program’s intended learning supported centrally through the outcomes. For an example of how this can be done through a learning management system Eberly Center [for Teaching Excellence (LMS), refer to the Learning Analytics Case Study in Section 1.3. and Educational Innovation]. The documentation showcases how programs use data and information to continually improve their quality and 2. Design the assessment of program-level learning outcomes with the content and effectiveness.”3 complexity of the learning outcomes in mind. Tools:4 In addition to a standard The validity of an assessment task will depend on the degree to which it assesses the Program Outcomes Chart,5 CMU makes available a Mastery Outcomes Grid6 implications of what students are intended to learn, so careful attention to the content and and an Outcomes Matrix to map complexity of learning expressed in the outcomes is important. As described in the SOLO outcomes from course to program taxonomy, program-level assessment should be aimed at learning outcomes in the relational levels. However, the assessment for improvement process at CMU and extended abstract levels. emphasizes disciplinary differences and avoids a ‘one size fits all’7 approach. “We approach assessment from a 3.

What information will this give me on how to improve my teaching or our program?”8 2 For more on assessment of program-level learning outcomes, refer to http://gototheexchange.ca/index.php/curriculum-overview/curriculum-models-and-design-principles. 3 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assessprogram/index.html 4 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assessprogram/toolsfacilitateprocess.html 5 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assessprogram/components.html 6 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assessprogram/masterygrid.html 7 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/history/ATFdocs/ATFpositionOnAssessment.pdf 8 http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/history/ATF.html 18 KROWEMARF DNA WEIVREVO — 1 NOITCES 1.3 CREATING A PLAN FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PROGRAM-LEVEL LEARNING OUTCOMES In this section, we provide recommendations on how to create a plan to ensure constructive alignment and to assess program-level learning outcomes. As outlined in the first two sections of the handbook, assessment of learning outcomes is a process of “making our expectations explicit and public; setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning quality; systematically gathering, analysing, and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and standards;

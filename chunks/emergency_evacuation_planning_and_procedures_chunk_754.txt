Information for Volunteer Fire Wardens George Brown College employees can volunteer to serve as fire wardens. Should an emergency occur, volunteer fire wardens are responsible for informing occupants of the need to evacuate a building, and directing those who may need assistance in order to safely evacuate. In general, the role of fire wardens in an emergency situation requiring evacuation is to  conduct a thorough search of their designated floor area to ensure occupants are alerted to the emergency.  direct people to leave the building immediately using the NEAREST EXIT STAIRWELL if it is safe to do so.  direct people who need help in evacuating the building to the NEAREST EXIT STAIRWELL (designated waiting area), and instruct them to wait on the landing inside the EXIT STAIRWELL for trained emergency professionals to help with evacuation, if it is safe to do so.  direct people to an alternate EXIT STAIRWELL if the NEAREST EXIT STAIRWELL is filled with smoke, impassable or otherwise unsafe.  Leave the building using the NEAREST EXIT STAIRWELL.  Notify college personnel stationed at the building’s annunciator panel exit of the exact location of people needing help with evacuation. Volunteer fire wardens do NOT have the professional training to physically evacuate people who need assistance in

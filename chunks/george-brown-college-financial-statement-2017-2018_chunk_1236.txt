This agreement which expires in 2109 has an initial rental period of 23 years at which point the rent will be reset based on the then fair market value of the land, its unimproved value and its intended educational use and tied to the CPI. The rental commitment for the initial 23 years has been included in the operating lease commitment schedule above. Effective December 21, 2003, the College entered into a lease agreement in connection with its joint venture (Note 4) to lease certain facilities for an initial term of twenty (20) years, with an option to extend the lease for five (5) successive terms of twenty years each. Annual lease payments under this agreement are $155 per annum for “grade level facilities” and $2 per square foot for “above grade premises”. Rent escalation is tied to CPI and is provided for during the period September 1, 2014 to February 29, 2024. The above lease agreement is superseded by an annual licensing agreement which commits the College to estimated annual payments of $260 for the use of the facilities. In the event of the cancellation of the licensing agreement, the lease agreement becomes enforceable. In a prior year, the College entered into an agreement, as part of the Ontario Government Superbuild Program, with Ryerson Polytechnic University to lease additional premises at the Sally Horsfall Eaton Centre for a term of forty nine years, with related total capital lease payments over the lease period estimated at $9,966. The premises are disclosed as “Building under capital lease” in Note 5. These capital lease payments were paid as at March 31, 2003, from Superbuild funding, fundraising and College funds. As a result, there is no related obligation under capital lease related to this facility. 21 The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology Notes to Financial Statements (expressed in thousands of dollars) March 31, 2018 10.

The Collegeâ€™s accounting policy for each category is as follows: 7 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2016 ($ amounts are in thousands) 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) (i) Fair value The College has designated its fixed income portfolio that would otherwise be classified into the amortized cost category at fair value as the College manages and reports performance of it on a fair value basis. They are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at fair value. Unrealized changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of remeasurement gains and losses until they are realized, when they are transferred to the statement of operations. Changes in fair value on restricted assets are recognized as a liability until the criterion attached to the restrictions has been met. Transaction costs related to financial instruments in the fair value category are expensed as incurred. Where a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, the amount of the loss is removed from accumulated remeasurement gains and losses and recognized in the statement of operations. On sale, the amount held in accumulated remeasurement gains and losses associated with that instrument is removed from net assets and recognized in the statement of operations. (ii) Amortized cost This category includes accounts receivable, grants receivable, receivable from George Brown College Foundation, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, liability for contaminated site, and long term debt. They are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses on financial assets, except for contributions, which are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs related to financial instruments in the amortized cost category are added to the carrying value of the instrument. Writedowns on financial assets in the amortized cost category are recognized when the amount of a loss is known with sufficient precision, and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets are then written down to net recoverable value with the writedown being recognized in the statement of operations. c) Inventories: Inventories other than books are valued at the lower of cost and net

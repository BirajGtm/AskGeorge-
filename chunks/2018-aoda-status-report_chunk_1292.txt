To make accessibility a reality throughout the organization, we recognize that all employees have a role in creating an accessible and inclusive college. Our goal is to ensure accessibility for all of our employees, our students and our community members who access services, products, resources or any of the facilities operated by the College. Where Are We Now: Implementing our Obligations under the AODA Legislative Updates There were no new legislative updates introduced in 2018. In March 2018, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) released its new Policy on Accessible Education for Students with Disabilities, along with recommendations on how to best meet legal obligations under Ontario’s Human Rights Code. This Policy replaces the previous document, Guidelines on Accessible Education (2004). In January 2019, the College received the following updates from the Ontario Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility: • In early 2018, two Standards Development Committees began exploring options for the removal of accessibility barriers in the Kindergarten-to-Grade 12 and Postsecondary sectors. The work of these committees has been on hold since last June, as the [Ontario Progressive Conservative Party majority] government considers options on the best way to address accessibility in the province's publicly-funded education system. • The Hon. David Onley’s Third Legislative Review of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act is due January 31, 2019. The Ontario government will be waiting to review Mr. Onley’s report before considering the best path forward to further improving accessibility in Ontario. 3 Multi-Year Plan George Brown College continues to work in accordance with the Multi-Year Accessibility Plan developed to meet our organizational obligations under the AODA, Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (O. Reg. 191/11, s. 4 (1) (2)). As GBC’s AODA obligations are far-reaching with varying levels of responsibility across the college, our multi-year plan reflects a strategic approach to implementation that assigns leadership and responsibility to various groups to ensure our accessibility goals are met. The multi-year plan is a fluid document and framework that provides high level deliverables and activities, and

determined as follows: Buildings and improvements 40 years Buildings under capital lease 49 years Leasehold improvements (GBSP) 20 years Equipment 5 years Automotive equipment 5 years Computer equipment 3 years (iii) Assets under capital leases The College leases a building on terms which transfer substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership to the College. This lease has been accounted for as a “capital lease” as though an asset had been purchased and a liability incurred. (g) Employee future benefits: The College recognizes employee future benefits (health, dental, life insurance, sick leave and other retirement obligations) as they are earned during the employee’s tenure of service using the projected benefit method based on management’s best estimate of assumptions. (h) Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenditures during the year. The most significant items subject to management estimation are the allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for sick leave benefits, employee future benefits and other employment related accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 9 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2012 1.

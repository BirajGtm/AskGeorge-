operations of the various student organizations. (b) Revenue recognition: The College follows the deferral method of accounting for restricted contributions. Operating grants are recorded as revenue in the period to which they relate. Grants earned but not received at the end of an accounting period are accrued. Where a portion of a grant relates to a future period, it is deferred and recognized in that subsequent period. Unrestricted contributions are recognized as revenue when received or receivable, if the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured. Externally restricted contributions, other than endowment contributions, are recognized as revenue in the year in which the related expenses are incurred. Contributions restricted for the purchase of capital assets are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis, at a rate corresponding with the amortization rate for the related capital assets. 7 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2011 1.

(c) Financial instruments: The College has classified each of its financial instruments into the undernoted accounting categories. The category for an item determines its accounting treatment under the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Standards on the recognition, measurement and presentation of Financial Instruments. Financial instrument Category Cash Held-for-trading Short term investments Held-for-trading Long term investments Held-for-trading Grants receivable Loans and receivables Accounts receivable Loans and receivables Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Other liabilities Long term liabilities Other liabilities Held-for-trading items are carried at fair value, with changes in their fair value measured in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the current period. “Loans and receivables” are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, net of any impairment. “Other liabilities” are measured at amortized cost. The carrying value of cash, grants receivable, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term maturity. Other accounts noted on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position such as inventories, prepaid expenses, deposits, capital assets, deferred revenues, sick leave benefits, employee future benefits and deferred contributions are not financial instruments. 8 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2011 1.

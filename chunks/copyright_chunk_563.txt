of Upper Canada, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 339, 2004 SCC 13. This document is available in accessible format Appendix A Association of Canadian Community Colleges Fair Dealing Policy The fair dealing provision in the Copyright Act permits use of a copyright-protected work without permission from the copyright owner or the payment of copyright royalties. To qualify for fair dealing, two tests must be passed. First, the "dealing" must be for a purpose stated in the Copyright Act: research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire, and parody. Educational use of a copyright- protected work passes the first test. The second test is that the dealing must be "fair." In landmark decisions in 2004 and in 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance as to what this test means in schools and post-secondary educational institutions. This Fair Dealing Policy applies fair dealing in non-profit K-12 schools and post-secondary educational institutions and provides reasonable safeguards for the owners of copyright- protected works in accordance with the Copyright Act and the Supreme Court decisions.

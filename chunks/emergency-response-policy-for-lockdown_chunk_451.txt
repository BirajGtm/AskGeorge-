within a campus building, posing an immediate threat to staff and students. Normal operations immediately cease. Movement into the building is restricted, and people inside the building are instructed to take cover, hiding in place, if they do not feel they can exit the premises safely. ENS Emergency Notification System. A system utilizing multiple platforms to send an emergency message to the community. The policy applies to the ENS in its current state and any future additional tools or technologies. Evacuation A state in which all occupants are required to leave the building in a quick but safe and orderly manner. Normally, this would be accomplished through the use of the fire alarm. Fire alarm procedures are documented in each building’s Fire Plan. EOC The Emergency Operations Centre is a physical or virtual location from which coordination and/or support of on-site activities is directed during a major emergency. POLICY George Brown College is committed to the safety and security of all occupants of our buildings, and to undertaking responsive and mitigating actions during an emergency. Procedures exist within the broader Emergency Management Plan, defining the process by which the College will respond to an emergency. The Plan provides authority for College officials to act and identifies the measures to be taken in response to an event which threatens the safety of College personnel. Control of the incident will require coordination of both internal College staff and external agencies, such as law enforcement. 2 The specific procedures for Lockdown, Hold and Secure, and Shelter in Place are contained within this policy, informing the roles and responsibilities of individuals, College faculty and staff, and external agencies throughout the duration and changing nature of the emergency event. This policy also covers the communication and post event procedures. Internal threats of violence tend to come from disturbed members of the community, more often than from people not connected to the college. Recognising that fact, it is important that all staff and students communicate any information or concerns about an individual or a potential situation which may result in a violent incident, to our Security staff. The college’s Public Safety and Security team is trained in threat assessment and in defusing and managing situations and issues before they escalate, and in doing so in a respectful way. The community’s safety risks are minimised when members come forward with information or concerns as soon as possible. PROCEDURES Appendix A – Lockdown Procedures Appendix B – Hold and Secure Procedures Appendix C – Shelter in Place Procedures NON-COMPLIANCE IMPLICATIONS This policy and the associated procedures are in place to safeguard the college community and general public, and non-compliance may result in additional risk to the individual and other community members. Education and training are crucial components to being prepared for the unexpected. All employees are expected to complete lockdown training and employees within college-operated buildings are expected to participate in periodic simulations or drills. Training material is available through PD Place, and reference materials via www.georgebrown.ca/publicsafety/.

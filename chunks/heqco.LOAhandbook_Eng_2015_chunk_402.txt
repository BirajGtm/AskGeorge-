Many factors contributed to creating an institutional culture of assessment at this college. First, implementing a committee on assessment allowed for a formal space where members could review, discuss and improve assessment within the institution. Second, establishing faculty leadership positions increased engagement, knowledge and participation. Lastly, ensuring that institutional leaders were part of the discussion helped to integrate matters of assessment into budget reviews, course evaluations and program creation. *Retrieved from Zubrow (2012) 46 YTICAPAC LANOITUTITSNI GNIPOLEVED — 3 NOITCES Formal Institutional Leaders Formal institutional leaders can directly impact the success of assessment efforts within an institution (Shipman, Aloi & Jones, 2003). Effective leaders are instrumental in promoting and fostering an institutional culture of assessment geared toward enhancing teaching and learning. It is important to note that effective leaders may trigger a cultural shift but successive leaders with similar values must maintain this shift. Researchers have identified leadership qualities and attitudes integral to implementing and maintaining a successful culture of assessment (Shipman Formal Institutional Leaders et al., 2003; Stayhorn, 2006; Baker et al., 2012). Effective leaders: Effective leaders engage in a number of essential activities: • provide a vision for assessment, especially at the program and institutional level; • Setting vision • Encouraging collaboration and • participate in program-level learning outcome assessment processes; engagement between faculty, staff, administrators, students and other • encourage collaborative assessment efforts between faculty, staff, administrators, students stakeholders and employers; • Providing an encouraging space and time for discussion and reflection • advocate for institutional incentives that encourage and recognize faculty and staff • Providing resources for enhancement participation in assessment efforts; • Encouraging dissemination • Recognizing time and effort and • make incremental, sustainable changes in assessment practices and policies; celebrating successes • know the strengths and weaknesses of the various assessments instruments and use this information to provide a framework for improvement of teaching and learning; • make resources available (e.g., for professional development of faculty and staff, program- level assessment and program enhancement, infrastructure/IT systems that allow more effective data analysis and visualization, etc.); • provide and encourage space for discussion and collaboration; • guide the institution to organize information around specific questions of interest that will help improve student learning; • provide time and processes to reflect and make meaning of the information gathered through program-level learning outcomes; • encourage dissemination of information in a transparent process – with a focus on ongoing enhancement; • use the information for institutional priorities, strategic planning, and decisions; and • celebrate successes. Institution-wide initiatives, especially concerning culture, perceptions and values, require representatives and leaders from various levels of the institution: faculty members, administrative staff, and students with different levels of expertise (Stayhorn, 2006). This multi- faceted approach to assessment helps to encourage a comprehensive, institution-wide culture and ensures access to important resources (Baker et al., 2012). 47 YTICAPAC LANOITUTITSNI GNIPOLEVED — 3 NOITCES RESOURCES Shifting an institution’s culture toward valuing assessment usually requires an allocation of funding, time, space, equipment, policies and staff, as well as the expertise necessary to facilitate change.

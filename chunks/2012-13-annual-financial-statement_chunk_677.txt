FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the College if a debtor fails to make payments of interest and principal when due. The College is exposed to this risk relating to its cash, investments, grants receivable, accounts receivable, and receivable from George Brown College Foundation. The College holds its cash accounts with a federally regulated chartered bank who is insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the event of default, the College’s cash accounts are insured up $100,000 (2012 - $100,000). The College’s investment policy operates within the constraints of the investment guidelines issued by the MTCU and puts limits on the bond portfolio including portfolio composition limits, issuer type limits, bond quality limits, aggregate issuer limits, corporate sector limits and general guidelines for geographic exposure. All fixed income portfolios are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management during the year. The guidelines permit the College’s funds to be invested in bonds issued by the Government of Canada, a Canadian province or a Canadian municipality having a rating of A or better, or corporate investments having a rating of AAA (high) or better. 30 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2013 21. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Accounts receivable is primarily due from students, government, and other large corporations. Credit risk is mitigated by the highly diversified nature of the student population. The College measures its exposure to credit risk based on how long the amounts have been outstanding. An impairment allowance is set up based on the College’s historical experience regarding collections. The amounts outstanding at year end were as follows: Past Due Total 1 - 30 days 31 - 60 days 61 - 90 days 91 - 120 days Over 120 days Government receivable $ 6,775,509 $ 6 ,775,509 $ - $ - $ - $ - Student receivable 12,003,752 5,628,528 6 64,960 1,480,741 865,975 3,363,548 Other receivable 5,270,560 5,270,560 - - - - Gross receivable 24,049,821 1 7,674,597 6 64,960 1,480,741 865,975 3,363,548 Less: impairment allowances (3,521,443) - (158,657) (634,631) (432,987) (2,295,168) Net receivable $ 2 0,528,378 $ 17,674,597 $ 506,303 $ 846,110 $ 432,988 $ 1,068,380 There have been no significant changes from the previous year in the exposure to risk or policies, procedures and methods used to measure the risk.

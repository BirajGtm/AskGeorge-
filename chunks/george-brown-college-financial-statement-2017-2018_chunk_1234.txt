Retirement benefits CAAT Pension Plan Employees of the College are members of the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Pension Plan (the “Plan”), which is a multi-employer jointly-sponsored defined benefit plan for eligible employees of public colleges and other employers in Ontario. The College makes contributions to the Plan equal to those of the employees. Contribution rates are set by the Plan’s governors to ensure the long term viability of the Plan. Any pension surplus or deficit is a joint responsibility of the members and employers and may affect future contribution rates. The College does not recognize any share of the Plan’s pension surplus or deficit. The most recent actuarial valuation filed with pension regulators as at January 1, 2018 indicated an actuarial surplus of $2,269,000 (2017 - $1,600,000). The College made contributions to the Plan and its associated retirement compensation arrangement of $16,299 (2017 - $16,340) which has been included in salaries and benefits in the statement of operations. 18 The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology Notes to Financial Statements (expressed in thousands of dollars) March 31, 2018 8. Post-Employment Benefits and Compensated Absences (continued) Post-employment benefits The College extends post employment life insurance, health and dental benefits to certain employee groups subsequent to their retirement. The College recognizes these benefits as they are earned during the employees’ tenure of service. The College also provides continuation of medical and dental benefits to certain employee groups while receiving long- term disability benefits. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council. The major actuarial assumptions employed for the valuation are as follows: (a) Discount rate The present value of employee future benefits as at March 31, 2018 was determined using a discount rate of 2.6% (2017 – 2.0%), while the 2018 period expense was calculated using a discount rate 2.0% (2017 – 1.7%). (b) Hospital and other medical Hospital and other medical costs were assumed to increase at 4.0% per annum (2017 – 4.0%). Medical premium increases were assumed to increase at 6.8% per annum in 2014 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.0% in 2034. (c) Drug costs Drug costs increases were assumed to increase at a rate of 8.0% per annum in 2018 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.0% in 2034. (d) Dental costs Dental costs were assumed to increase at 4.0% per annum (2017 – 4.0%).

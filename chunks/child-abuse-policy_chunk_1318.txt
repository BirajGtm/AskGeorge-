LEGAL REQUIREMENTS The Child and Family Services Act Duty to report: In accordance with the Child and Family Services Act, it is the responsibility of every person in Ontario, to immediately report to a Children’s Aid Society it he / she believes that child abuse has occurred or if there is a risk of abuse, ( C.F.S.A. 72(1)). In Ontario, a person is a child from birth until his or her 16th birthday. The legislation places additional responsibility on individuals who perform professional or official duties with respect to children, to report his / her suspicion of child abuse or risk of abuse to a Children’s Aid Society. This includes any operator or Staff of a day nursery (C.F.S.A. 72 (3)). Failure to report: It is an offence under the Child and Family Services Act to contravene one’s reporting responsibilities. The penalty imposed (a fine of up to $1000.00) emphasizes that a child’s safety must take precedence over all other concerns (C.F.S.A. 85 (1)). Confidentiality: The professional’s duty to repot suspicions of child abuse overrides the provisions of any other provisional statute, specifically those provisions that would otherwise prohibit disclosure by a professional or official ( C.F.S.A. 72 (7)). The only exception to this is lawyer / client privilege (C.F.S.A. 72 (8)). Protection from Liability: All persons making a report of suspected child abuse are protected against civil action, unless that person is proven to have acted “….maliciously or without reasonable grounds for the belief or suspicion ….” (C.F.S.A.) 15 (6)).

College Wide Orientation: George Brown College runs one of the most comprehensive orientation programs for new students. The focus of the • red esign was to align the Academic Orientation events with the College’s Student Success Strategy. The strategy has Ongoing Orientation as one of the three pillars. The redesign consisted of a new outcomes-based approach to planning. The three outcomes that have been adopted are: 1) student success messaging to reduce anxiety, 2) student to student connections and 3) student to faculty/staff connections. The focus is to ensure that students make connections within the first few weeks of studies to heighten the likelihood that the student will feel like they belong and will experience a smooth transition to college. Research has shown that this increases the likelihood of student persistence. In 2009-10, the College moved all but one academic centre to a single location and in a survey of more than 2,500 students, 83% (up from 56% in 2008) felt that they made useful connections with peers, 84% felt connected to faculty/staff (up from 43% in 2008) and 95% felt welcomed (up from 80% in 2008). ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 30 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities 15) Quality of the Learning Environment Please provide information in the space provided below of what George Brown did in 2009-10 to enhance the quality of the learning environment and what strategies are in place to continue and enhance quality.

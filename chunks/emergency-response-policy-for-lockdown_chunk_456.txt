movement or activities will apply. If there is a violent crime scene associated with the lockdown, or Police think there could be residual risks, then a room-by-room guided evacuation of the building will be conducted by Toronto Police Services, working with Campus Security. In this case:  People should remain in place, hidden and secure, until Police and/or Security come to the room. Police Services and Campus Security will have a key to unlock locked doors. They will announce themselves before attempting to open the door. Do not open the door for them.  If the door was secured by means other than locking it (e.g., by blocking it, using a belt of the opener, etc.), then room occupants will need to help open the door. If occupants have any concerns about who is requesting the door be opened, they should first contact Campus Security Dispatch at “0” on an internal phone (or call 416-415-4000 from a cell phone), tell them the location and how the person asking for access has identified themselves. Dispatch will then verify the identities and location and inform the caller if it is safe to unsecure the door. 7 Action Responsibility  Room occupants are to follow the specific directions by the police for how and where to leave the building. The Police may have specific directions about what personal effects or materials can or cannot be taken when leaving, which must be followed. 4 End of a Lockdown After a thorough investigation of the campus or building Police Services Police Services, PSS will inform the PSS team member they are working with, that the area management, VP is considered safe.

projects about the mechanics and real world applications of energy efficiency improvements and retrofits. Technical Measures: George Brown College will focus on achieving the Energy CDM goals by completing energy audits, upgrading equipment with new technology and by looking at processes to maximize the energy efficiency in key areas of the College. Organizational Measures Specify and install energy efficient equipment on any new renovation project or equipment replacement project. Investigate possible corporate policies to support demand reduction measures for peak load shedding and to reduce plug load in buildings. Revised: June 16, 2014 George Brown College 2014-2019 Energy CDM Plan Behavioural Measures 1. 2014 – 2016: Energy Fairs to be held annually at each Campus on a rotating basis starting in the Fall of 2014 2. 2016: Eco-Rep program in the new student residence: peer mentoring on energy conservation and other “green” living tips. Educational Measures: The Green Team Monthly Go Green Campaign will continue to include regular communications related to energy savings initiatives and providing tips and resources on issues of conservation and sustainability. As part of the College’s Centre for Construction and Engineering Technologies, a suite of courses including Capstone projects are providing students with real world learning about applications of building envelope and automation technologies that relate directly to energy conservation. The students are using the diverse range of building technologies found within the GBC group of campuses as their subjects. Energy CDM Monitoring and Measuring 1. Review monthly energy bills on a per campus basis for overall performance to main goals 2. Install Real-time monitoring devices on key equipment to track energy performance 3. Provide updates on key measures through the GBC Green Team 4. Provide updates annually to Senior Management progress towards achieving goals. Energy CDM Cost and Savings Estimates The estimated costs and savings for the proposed Technical Measures are: a) Casa Loma Energy Audit estimated cost is $150,000, projected savings is $100,000 b) Casa Loma Capital Replacement Project to replace Space Heating Boilers and Domestic Hot Water Boilers estimated costs $900,000, projected energy savings is $12,000 annually c) St. James 290 Adelaide Chiller Replacement estimated cost $350,000, saving to be determined d) St. James 193 King Roof-top HVAC units estimated cost $100,000, savings to be determined e) St. James Water Riser Replacement Project estimated at $250,000, savings to be determined.

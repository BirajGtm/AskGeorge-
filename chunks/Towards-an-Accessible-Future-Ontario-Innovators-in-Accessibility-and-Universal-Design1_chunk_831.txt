The Martin Prosperity Institute predicts that adoption of universally designed products and services People with disabilities across numerous market segments in the US and market ($8 billion) Ontario is a $2 trillion business opportunity. Furthermore, investment in universally designed products and services Universally designed may lead to three key benefits for Ontario’s economy and products and services its businesses: improved productivity, increased innovation market ($2,000 billion) and extended workforce participation.24 An inclusive society presents an enormous opportunity Figure 5: Market opportunity for products and services — a $2 trillion one — for innovators. The demand for targeted at people with disabilities, and compared innovations in this space has spurred the creation of to the market opportunity designed using Universal startups and research institutes across the globe. A few Design principles examples are: How to move forward? The answer lies in Universal • MIT AgeLab (US) – investigates the use of Design (UD). The UN Convention of Rights for People technologies to enhance quality of life of an aging with Disabilities defines UD as the design of products, population () environments, programs and services to be usable by all • Institute of Design at Stanford (US) – produces people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need creative design solutions to complex issues that for adaptation or specialized design. UD principles are: affect everyone using a collaborative approach Equitable use • Center for Universal Design (US) – evaluates, develops, and promotes accessible and universal Flexible in use design in housing, commercial and public facilities, outdoor environments, and products Simple and intuitive in use • Centre for Excellence in Universal Design (Ireland) Perceptible information – develops standards and solutions to allow for a more accessible products

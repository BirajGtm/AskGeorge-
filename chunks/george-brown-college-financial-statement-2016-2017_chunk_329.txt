of the College. The maximum amount of any potential future payment cannot be reasonably estimated. c) In the normal course of business, the College has entered into agreements that include indemnities in favour of third parties, such as student work placement agreements. These indemnification agreements may require the College to compensate counterparties for losses incurred by the counterparties as a result of breaches in representation and regulations or as a result of litigation claims or statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. The terms of these indemnities are not explicitly defined and the maximum amount of any potential reimbursement cannot be reasonably estimated. The nature of these indemnification agreements prevents the College from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum exposure due to the difficulties in assessing the amount of liability which stems from the unpredictability of future events and the unlimited coverage offered to counterparties. Historically, the College has not made any significant payments under such or similar indemnification agreements and therefore no amount has been recorded in the statement of financial position with respect to these agreements. 19.

Financial Instrument Classification The following table provides cost and fair value information of financial instruments by category. The maximum exposure to credit risk would be the carrying value as shown below. 2017 Amortized Fair Value Cost Total Cash $ 81,615 $ - $ 81,615 Short-term investments 28,366 - 28,366 Grants receivable - 446 446 Accounts receivable - 29,735 29,735 Receivable from George Brown College Foundation - 13,556 13,556 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities - 53,786 53,786 Liability for contaminated site - 806 806 Long-term debt - 56,727 56,727 Short-term investments consist of federal and provincial government and Canadian public company debt instruments. The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities using the last bid price; - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 29 The George Brown College of Applied Arts

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenditures during the year. The most significant items subject to management estimation are the allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for sick leave benefits, employee future benefits and other employment related accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 8 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2010 2. Changes in accounting policy: Adoption of accounting policies (i) Series of Sections 4400 - Not-for-profit organizations In September 2008, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued amendments to several of the existing sections on accounting, measurement and financial reporting by Not-for-profit organizations contained in the 4400 series of Sections of the CICA Handbook. The adoption of these amendments has not resulted in any change in how the College accounts for its transactions. (ii) Section 1000 - Financial statement concepts On April 1, 2009, the College adopted the amendments made to Section 1000 “Financial statement concepts”. The amended section requires an entity to demonstrate that any expenditure that it wishes to present as an asset meets the conceptual definition of an asset or is permitted to be recorded as assets under specific CICA Handbook section, and any revenue that it wishes to present as liability must meet the definition of a liability including a restricted contribution under Section 4410. The adoption of these amendments has not resulted in any change in how the College accounts for its transactions. (iii) EIC-173 - Credit risk and the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities In January 2009, the Emerging Issues Committee issued EIC-173 “Credit risk and the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities”. This abstract requires that an entity's own credit risk (for financial liabilities) and the credit risk of the counterparty (for financial assets) should be taken into account in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative instruments. The new guidance did not have any impact on the valuation of the College’s financial assets and liabilities, or its net assets. 9 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2010 3.

the classroom to clarify issues of concern and by providing reasonable assistance with course work at a time that is agreed upon by both parties; - respond to special needs identified by a student by directing the student to appropriate resources within the College that might be of assistance in meeting course objectives; - consult, where required, with Disabilities Services or with their Chair or Dean for help in determining how to reasonably accommodate a student with special needs. 4.2 Conflict Resolution Faculty will strive actively to resolve conflict between themselves and any student and should make an effort to resolve conflict between students; In the event of conflict between faculty and student, the faculty member will meet with the student and maintain an open, non-confrontational attitude while attempting to resolve the problem at hand. In the event of conflict between students, faculty will intervene by making verbal attempts at conciliation; if these are not successful, faculty should immediately notify the appropriate authority according to the procedural guidelines established in the College Policy on Emergencies and the College Policy on Student Discipline in Non-academic Matters. Academic employees should refrain from physical intervention to resolve a conflict. Academic employees should behave toward students with circumspection, avoiding conduct on College premises that might result in the imposition of College sanctions or civil or criminal proceedings.

In the event that no other section of the class exists, the Chair of the student's program should be approached to resolve the issue and to protect the interests of the faculty member, the student, and other students. 5 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FACULTY AND STAFF Behaviour that is inappropriate inside the classroom (see 1.1) is equally inappropriate in relationships with other faculty and staff. 5.1 Conduct with Faculty When interacting with other academic employees/colleagues, faculty will: - behave with courtesy, respect, patience, helpfulness, and a general spirit of goodwill in their interactions;

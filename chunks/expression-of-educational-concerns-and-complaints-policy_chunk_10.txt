SCOPE This policy provides transparent information to the George Brown College community on how program- level and college-wide academic concerns and complaints will be managed. It is the intent of this policy to ensure that students have access to a clear process that is founded on fairness, impartiality, accessibility, respect and responsiveness, and which supports students in their attempts to address educational concerns or complaints. This policy concerns student complaints about the quality of the students’ academic educational experience. Certain types of academic concerns or complaints are not considered within the scope of this policy may be covered in one or more of the following: • The Academic Appeals Policy is used by a student for the objection to or appeal of a specific academic decision involving that student. • The Academic Integrity Policy describes the obligation to and procedures for speaking out publicly or lodging complaints confidentially when academic integrity is believed to have been breached by another student (e.g. cheating). • The Code of Student Behaviour and Community Standards Policy describes a mechanism for conflict resolution between students or to lodge a formal complaint about the behaviour of another student that violates the standards set by George Brown College. • Other policies that govern student concerns not specifically focused on academic educational experiences include but are not limited to the Accessible Learning Policy, the Human Rights Discrimination and Harrassment Policy.

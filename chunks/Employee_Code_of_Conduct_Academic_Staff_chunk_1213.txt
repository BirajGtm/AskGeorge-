and the student (for example, if the academic employee is a relative, spouse, close friend, or lover of the student), arrangements should be made to assign the student to a different section of the same class. In the event that no other section of the class exists, the Chair of the student's program should be approached to resolve the issue and to protect the interests of the faculty member, the student, and other students. 5 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FACULTY AND STAFF Behaviour that is inappropriate inside the classroom (see 1.1) is equally inappropriate in relationships with other faculty and staff. 5.1 Conduct with Faculty When interacting with other academic employees/colleagues, faculty will: - behave with courtesy, respect, patience, helpfulness, and a general spirit of goodwill in their interactions; - share educational resources such as audiovisual equipment, computer facilities, and learning resource materials; - vacate classrooms in a timely fashion so as not to inconvenience incoming faculty; - leave classrooms reasonably clean and orderly, with boards cleared and seating arrangements restored to the layout standard for that classroom, so that incoming faculty will not have to perform housekeeping chores before beginning class; - refuse to engage in or condone gossip, innuendo, or any other activities that would malign or otherwise damage a colleague; - refrain from talking about a faculty member or another course or program in a public manner or with students. Instead, students should be encouraged to share their concerns with either the faculty member involved or the faculty member’s chair. Faculty who are directly affected by unprofessional or troublesome conduct on the part of a colleague should express their concern directly to that colleague in an attempt to clarify and correct the situation. Should such an intervention be unsuccessful (that is, if the behaviour persists), faculty members should advise the colleague that they will speak to the appropriate Chair. Approved by Board of Governors Motion #03–05–04, 11 February 2004, Publication 2004 – 03 – 31 George Brown College – Academic Policies, Guidelines & Codes of Conduct – 2004-03 – Faculty will, without exception, maintain confidentiality when attempting to resolve issues and will base all reports of concern on direct behavioural observations of the colleague involved. Whenever possible, these observations should be documented in writing. 5.2 Conduct with College Support Staff Faculty are expected to: - treat support staff with courtesy and respect; - behave toward support staff in a circumspect manner, avoiding conduct or comments that are or could be reasonably construed as being discriminatory in nature or that might result in the imposition of College sanctions or civil or criminal proceedings; - respect the professionalism of support staff and to honour and abide by the systems and procedures that support staff members have established to enable them to function effectively; - assist support staff by handing in time sheets, records of grades, and other documents that must be processed according to a College schedule at the times requested by support staff and in the format specified; - respect the terms and conditions of the support staff collective agreement and

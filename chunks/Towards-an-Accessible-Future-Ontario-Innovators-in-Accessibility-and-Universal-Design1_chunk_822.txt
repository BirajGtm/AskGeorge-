1). In Ontario, 15.5% of the population This tendency is directly correlated to a person’s health: as (about 1.85 million individuals, or 1 in 7 people) reported overall health declines due to acute and chronic disease, having a disability in 2006 (Table 1). disability rates increase. The incidence of chronic diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and arthritis) increases with age.4 In fact, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care estimates that 80% of those over the age of 45 (roughly 3.7 million Ontarians) were living with a chronic condition in 2003.5 Population with a disability, by region, 2006 Furthermore, as our seniors continue to age, the likelihood of developing multiple chronic diseases increases, and with it, the likelihood of disability Canada 14.3% (Figure 3). The world’s population, and in particular Canada’s, Nunavut is aging. Canada’s median age was 39.7 years in Northwest Territories 2010 and is expected to increase to over 45 years Quebec by 2050. This contrasts with a median age of 26.2 years back in 1971.6 The demographic shift, Yukon Territory brought on by people living longer and having Alberta fewer children, is expected to be a key factor in the Newfoundland doubling of the number of people with disabilities by 2036.

Source: Statistics Canada a) The level of severity depends on the frequency and intensity of the limitations associated with the disability. For example, a person who has no difficulty walking and climbing stairs but cannot stand in line for more than twenty minutes would have a mild mobility-related disability. A person who can only move around in a wheelchair would have their mobility more severely limited, and one who is bedridden for a long term period would have a very severe mobility-related disability. The levels of severity for individual disabilities are combined to provide a measure of the overall level of severity.

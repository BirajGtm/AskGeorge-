Purpose 1.1. George Brown College (the “college”) believes and acknowledges that: • every member of the college community should experience and contribute to an understanding and respectful learning, working and living environment that is free from discrimination, harassment and hate; • it should foster a climate of understanding and mutual respect, so each member of its community feels able to contribute to college activities and objectives; • it is public policy in Ontario to recognize the inherent dignity and worth of every person, and to provide for equal rights and opportunities without discrimination. 1.2. The policy is to help fulfil these beliefs and to achieve and maintain compliance with the Human Rights Code and the Ministry of Training Colleges and Universities Act. 1.3. This policy supports the proactive creation of an inclusive post-secondary environment at the college, as well as the effective response to reports and complaints of harassment, discrimination and hate as defined within the policy and in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code. 2. Policy Statement and Commitment The college is committed to creating, fostering, and maintaining a welcoming and affirming learning and working and living environment, where all our community members feel a sense of inclusion and belonging. The college will continue to take meaningful, deliberate, and sustained action to address harassment, discrimination, and hate in all forms, including the hate experienced by members of racialized and minoritized communities including Asian, Black, Indigenous, Jewish, Muslim, 2SLGBTQIA+ communities and persons with disabilities and all communities protected under the Ontario Human Rights Code.

her name associated with the work / performance), (ii) the right of association (the author’s / performer’s right to prevent the use of the work/performance in association with a cause or organization that would be prejudicial to the author’s/performer’s honour or reputation), and (iii) the right of integrity (the right to prevent changes to the work/performance that would be prejudicial to the author’s /performer’s honour or reputation). Unlike economic copyrights, moral rights always belong to the author/ performer. They cannot be assigned or licensed; they can only be waived, i.e., the author/performer agrees not to exercise his or her moral rights. It is very difficult to determine what an author/ performer will consider to be prejudicial to his or her reputation or honour. In general, consideration must be given to the nature of the student’s use and manipulation of copyright protected works to determine if the author’s/performer’s moral rights have been infringed. Work produced for a classroom assignment for a professor may carry limited risk of legal action. However, student work that is created initially as a classroom assignment but published on the College’s or on the student’s website may increase the risk of legal action, if appropriate permissions are not obtained. c) Further, students must comply with the various licensing agreements granted to the College. The use of these materials is governed by the terms of the licensing agreement or other contracts between the College/professor and the vendor/copyright holder. These contractual obligations supersede fair dealing as determined in the Copyright Act. (d) It is not easy to determine precisely the situations in which students must obtain the copyright owner’s permission for the use of a work. Generally, incorporating quotations of textual material into written assignments does not require the permission of the copyright owner. However, for manipulation of visual works, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, and the like, the permission of the copyright owner is required (subject to the exception found in Article 3.4). See Appendix A for further guidance on the application of fair dealing to particular This document is available in accessible format situations. (e) Where the copyright owner has authorized the use of a work, a record of the terms of the authorization must be kept by the student, including the parties to the agreement, the date of the agreement, the title of the work(s) used, the use(s) authorized, the duration of the agreement, and any conditions (please see Appendix E for permissions procedures). (f) Sources must be indicated whenever others’ ideas or material created by others are incorporated into student assignments. Not to do so constitutes plagiarism, which is a form of academic dishonesty (See Ch. IX of the College’s Academic Policies, Guidelines & Codes of Conduct). (g) The College will not provide protection or assistance to students facing charges arising from copyright infringement. 3.1 Student use of Library Holdings 3.1.1 Fair Dealing Copies of library holdings may be made in accordance with Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) Fair Dealing Policy and the Copyright Act and the Supreme Court Decision , CCH Canadian Ltd. v.

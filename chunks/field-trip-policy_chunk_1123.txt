George Brown College _______________________________________ Field Trip and Activities off Premises Policy for Lab Schools _______________________________________ 1 Philosophy We believe that our program is enhanced when it reflects the resources and interests that are unique to our area and families. We believe the optimum learning environment is one that integrates the playroom with the home and community. Therefore, field trips can be rich learning opportunities when they are relevant to the children’s interests and meaningful to the children’s particular stage of development. Ratios Staff is acutely aware of the importance of adequate coverage on all trips. The normal ratios will be augmented with students, volunteers, and families. Whenever there is inadequate supervision the trip will be cancelled. Identification Each child and adult is required to wear identification such as a safety vest/t-shirt/hat to maximize visibility as well as to identify the centre’s name and telephone number. Family Participation Families are always welcome to accompany the Staff and children on a field trip. Families will only be responsible for their own child when on a field trip unless a Vulnerable Sector Screening has been completed and a copy has been made available to the centre’s Manager as per the requirements of the Ministry of Education. 2 Preparation for the Trip All fieldtrips and excursions must be pre-approved by the Manager.  A great deal of thought is given to the trip destination and the suitability of the trip sit is carefully considered. There must be shady areas for rest periods and accessiblity to washroom facilities. The amount of walking must be appropriate to the age of the children. Strollers may be taken to alternate children when necessary.  Families will be informed of the trip in advance.  A first aid kit will accompany each group of children.  Each group will carry the emergency sheet for each child and Staff who goes on the trip.  Staff carry a documented list of food allergies/food restrictions and children’s names.  Necessary extra clothing and diapers will be taken.  The Centre Cook/Caterer will prepare a picnic lunch if required. The necessary food will be carried in a thermal bag to maintain it at the proper serving temperature.  Staff will survey the area to identify any possible hazards (i.e. stairs, escalators, water, etc.).  Centre Managers will accompany the Staff and children on any trip involving swimming in large water facilities or lakes.  Staff will ensure that all children are appropriately dressed for the weather (i.e. sun hats and sunscreen in the summer; hats, mitts, and scarves in the winter, etc.).  Once the destination has been reached, a designated safe area (customer service area) will be arranged in the event that the groups get separated. Staff will assess the trip site upon arrival to identify “hot spots” (where Staff need to position themselves for necessary supervision)  In the event of extreme weather (cold, heat, humidity, or air quality), the trip will be re- scheduled.  A cell phone will be taken on the trip. The cell phone number will be written

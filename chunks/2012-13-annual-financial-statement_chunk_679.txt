risk that the College will not be able to meet all cash outflow obligations as they come due. The College mitigates this risk by monitoring cash activities and expected outflows through extensive budgeting and maintaining investments that may be converted to cash in the near-term if unexpected cash outflows arise. The follow table sets out the contractual maturities (representing undiscounted contractual cash-flows of financial liabilities): Maturity profile of bonds held is as follows: 2013 Within Within Within Over 1 year 2-5 years 6-10 years 10 years Total Carrying value $ 5,729,169 $ 2 1,017,562 $ - $ - $ 2 6,746,731 Percent of Total 21% 79% 0% 0% 100% Accounts payable and accrued liabilities mature within one year. There have been no significant changes from the previous year in the exposure to risk or policies, procedures and methods used to measure the risk. 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENT Subsequent to year-end, the College has signed a loan agreement with the Ontario Financing Authority (“OFA”) for $35,000,000. The purpose of the loan is to finance construction costs and the acquisitions of furniture and equipment for the new Centre of Health Sciences locate on the Colleges waterfront campus. 23.

One of the core values of George Brown College is its dedication to diversity and respect, ensuring that as a college community we show mutual respect for each other, in all our behaviour. This assurance to a college culture of inclusion is necessary in fostering a rich learning and working environment. To this end the college is entrusted with developing policies, practices and procedures on providing goods, services, resources, facilities, employment, accommodation, buildings, structures or premises, that respect the dignity and independence of people with disabilities. The purpose of this accessibility policy is to provide clear guidance on how the college will achieve the applicable obligations and responsibilities under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 11 and the O. Reg. 191/11: Integrated Accessibility Standards, in adherence with the following key principles: Dignity - services provide respect and dignity for persons with disabilities. Independence - freedom from control or influence of others; the freedom to make one’s own choices. Integration - persons with disabilities may benefit from the same services, in the same place and in the same or similar way as other customers. Equal Opportunity - persons with disabilities have the same access as others to obtain, use and benefit from goods or services. BACKGROUND The AODA became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario developed mandatory accessibility standards that identify, remove and prevent barriers for people with disabilities. Effective July 1, 2016, the Customer Service Standards (which came into effect on January 1, 2008), have been consolidated with the Integrated Accessibility Standards into one regulation, the O. Reg. 191/11: Integrated Accessibility Standards (under Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. 11), which includes the following five accessibility standards: • Information and Communication Standards; • Employment Standards; • Transportation

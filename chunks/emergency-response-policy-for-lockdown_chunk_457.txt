which case information would be provided by Toronto Police on that process and where to meet. If a building is the scene of a crime, access to the building may be curtailed for a time by Police Services; Police Services and the College’s Emergency Management Team would in that case coordinate action and communication. Media inquiries will be directed to the Communications lead person Communications for response. All stakeholder communications and media communications/inquiries will be managed by the Communications Department under the crisis communications plan. After such an event there would be many activities and resources available. The Communications Department would provide a more detailed communication to the faculty/staff/students on next steps and resources available, but they would include:  Counselling services will be available for students through Counselling and Counselling and Disabilities Services. Information on how to Disabilities Services access the services will be sent in the communication to students.  Counselling Services for staff are available through EAP and Human Resources information on the access to EAP will be sent to staff. 8 APPENDIX B HOLD AND SECURE PROCEDURES A “Hold and Secure” is GBC’s response to an ongoing situation outside that requires all persons to remain in the building (e.g., a bank robbery nearby). All movement in to and out of the college building(s) is restricted – exterior doors are locked, preventing entry, and people inside the building need to remain there. Exterior facing windows should be covered if possible and lights dimmed. Otherwise, normal operations may continue inside the building. Action Responsibility 1. Initiating a Hold and Secure If there is an Emergency situation where a Hold and Secure is required, PSS management direction will be given by PSS Management. Hold and Secure activation will be initiated by the Security Team at the affected campus. Depending on the emergency, PSS Management will act on advice from Emergency Services (Toronto Police or other external response agencies) as it pertains to the situation. 1.1 Campus Security dispatch will implement Hold and Secure by using the Campus Security ENS to announce Hold and Secure within the affected campus or building, by all text and speech methods currently available within the ENS system, including telephones, speakers, and digital signage. 1.2 Campus Security will lock all exterior doors to the building, preventing Campus Security entry. Where possible, all exterior doors will have a security member or designated warden stationed nearby, to advise community members that it is not safe to leave the building. 1.3 Management of PSS will then be notified by Campus Security of the Campus Security Hold and Secure status and given all information pertaining to the event and action taken. 1.4 The Vice President, Corporate Services and the Vice President, PSS management Marketing, Student Life & Alumni will be notified by a member of the PSS team with a full accounting of why the Hold and Secure was called and what actions have taken place. This will result in the launch of the Emergency Plan, and opening of the EOC, as well as initiating the Crisis Communication Plan. 2. Staff

Staff Development web site and populated it with the key resources: http://www.georgebrown.ca/staffdevelopment/contract-faculty.aspx. Overall, the participation in training and developmental activities by this group of faculty increased by 50% over the past year. Faculty performance review: In 2009-2010 the Staff Development Department implemented a formative performance review process for all full- time faculty. There are four parts to the review process. Each faculty member must create a Teaching Portfolio that identifies his/her teaching philosophy, course outlines, curriculum that they have created, summaries of student feedback, and a variety of other artefacts that lend support to the Teaching Philosophy. We have a dedicated faculty member in Staff Development who is available to assist each faculty member in the creation of their portfolio. The second part of the process is at least two peer observations of classes. Following the observations, the observers provide self-reflective feedback on the class that was observed. The third part of the review is a Chair observation of a class. Following that observation the Chair provides pointed strengths-based feedback to the faculty member. The fourth part of the review process is a summary meeting between the faculty member and the Chair where the Chair and faculty member review the contents of the Portfolio, review the classroom feedback and based upon these data construct a 3-year Professional Development Plan. That plan is then submitted to the Staff Development office (where programs are developed to support the needs of faculty) and supports are put into place to help the faculty achieve their plans. The Professional Development Plan consists of two broad areas: how the faculty member intends to enhance his/her teaching practice and, secondly, how the faculty member intends to maintain currency in his/her vocation (dual professionalism). ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 25 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Learning community: There is a huge emphasis placed upon encouraging faculty to share their best practices cross departmentally as well as to share common challenges. The learning community is not limited to faculty only but includes support staff and managers. As an example, in June Staff Development held a three day retreat for faculty and support staff where each group explored ways that they could work together to enhance student learning including formal and informal learning. A total of 60 staff actively participated in this activity. In 2010, we plan to engage administrative staff in the retreat which will bring the total staff participation in this important event to 90. In addition, 60 faculty each semester engage in the “Learning Squares” program. Faculty are divided into groups of four (from different Divisions and with different degrees of experience). During the semester, each faculty member agrees to invite the other three members of their “square” to observe one of their classes. At the end of the semester, the group of four reconvenes and each member provides verbal self-reflective feedback to the rest of the group. As an example, one faculty member might say, “As a result of observing the classes that I was invited to attend, I learned that I my teaching practice is strong

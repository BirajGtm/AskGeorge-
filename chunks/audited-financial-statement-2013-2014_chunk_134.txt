The College holds its cash accounts with a federally regulated chartered bank who is insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the event of default, the College’s cash accounts are insured up to $100,000 (2013 - $100,000).

All fixed income portfolios are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management during the year. The guidelines permit the College’s funds to be invested in bonds issued by the Government of Canada, a Canadian province or a Canadian municipality having a rating of A or better, or corporate investments having a rating of AAA (high) or better.

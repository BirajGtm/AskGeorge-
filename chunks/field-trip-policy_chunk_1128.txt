that treats for your child should not be given during the field trip. Some children have specific allergies, and the Lab Child Care Centre packs a nutritionally balanced picnic lunch that takes allergies and food restrictions into account. If your child receives a treat that is not shared by the others, the rest of the children will not understand, and it may pose a health risk for you to bring treats for the group. All children must be supervised within a pre-planned area, and not taken to another place during the field trip. Staying with the group is a safety issue, as all children must be accounted for at all times. The children also find it confusing if they know that some children are allowed to play in an area to which they are not given access. It is important to keep both hands free so that the adult can attend to any child in need. Some of the children do get tired and would like to be carried, but when you have two children under your supervision, this becomes a safety issue. Arriving a bit earlier than the departure time is a requirement as sunscreen, extra clothing, and packing the picnic lunch takes time and organization. Any assistance is welcomed. If you know in advance that you will be leaving the group early and not coming back to the Lab Child Care Centre, please pre-arrange this with the Educators. In order to ensure safety, a high ratio of adult to child is needed, especially on the trip back to the Centre when the children are fatigued. Before the trip is undertaken, the Staff must be sure that they will have a sufficient number of adults to assist with all parts of the trip. Smoking is not permitted while on field trips and personal cell phone use is prohibited. In order to ensure consistency, we ask that families follow the Staffâ€™s lead with regard to behaviour guidance. Thanks to all the families who have helped us on field trips! Revised June 2017 8

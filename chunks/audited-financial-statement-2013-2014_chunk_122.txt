are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs related to financial instruments in the amortized cost category are added to the carrying value of the instrument. Writedowns on financial assets in the amortized cost category are recognized when the amount of a loss is known with sufficient precision, and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets are then written down to net recoverable value with the writedown being recognized in the statement of operations. c) Inventories: Inventories other than books are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost being determined on the first-in first-out basis. Books are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost being determined using the retail inventory method, which approximates average cost. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated cost to make the sale. 8 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2014 1.

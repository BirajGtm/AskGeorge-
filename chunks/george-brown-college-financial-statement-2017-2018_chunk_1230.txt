post-employment future benefits are actuarially determined using management’s best estimate of health care costs, disability recovery rates and discount rates. Adjustments to these costs arising from changes in estimates and experience gains and losses are amortized to income over the estimated average remaining service life of the employee groups on a straight line basis. (ii) The costs of the multi-employer defined benefit pension are the employer’s contributions due to the plan in the period. (iii) The cost of vesting and non-vesting sick leave benefits are actuarially determined using management’s best estimate of salary escalation, employees’ use of entitlement and discount rates. Adjustments to these costs arising from changes in actuarial assumption and/or experience are recognized over the estimated average remaining service life of the employees. (iv) The discount rate used in the determination of the above-mentioned liabilities is equal to the College’s internal rate of borrowing. i) Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with PSAB for Government NPOs requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Areas of key estimation include determination of deferred revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, capital asset amortization, amortization of deferred capital contributions, contamination liability, and actuarial estimation of post-employment benefits and compensated absences liabilities. 12 The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology Notes to Financial Statements (expressed in thousands of dollars) March 31, 2018 2.

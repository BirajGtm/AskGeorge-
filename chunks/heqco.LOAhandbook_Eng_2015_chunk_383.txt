They have been categorized by the types of learning outcomes they are best suited to assess, with the expectation that most can be adapted to assess more than one learning outcome. Each of these possible tasks was chosen because of its consistency with the principles outlined in Section 1. While these assessments are embedded in individual courses it is important to consider how they can be arranged to scaffold across the program. Introductory-level assessments placed early in the program can be reinforced later in the program. As long as courses are constructively aligned, course embedded assessment data can be used to report progress and achievement of program learning outcomes. Section 3 will focus on the development of institutional cultures that support authentic and aligned assessment, thus increasing the likelihood of both uptake and sustainability. SECITCARP TNEMSSESSA — 2 NOITCES ASSESSMENT PRACTICES This section summarizes assessment tasks for particular sets proficiency. The complementary focus is on competence as of program-level learning outcomes likely to be authentic in it is acquired and developed by students within their regular multiple disciplinary and professional contexts. While they are academic programs, and how that competence might be categorized within one form of learning outcome to help you enhanced and assessed” (p. 26). The choice of assessments find and select tasks, each can be used to assess several types occurs within an intentional plan for assessment of program- of learning outcomes. Many can be adapted for individual, pair level learning outcomes so that a strategic framework is used or group assessment and most can be implemented in face-to- to examine the whole program and systematically generate face, online, blended or hybrid courses. All of the tasks were evidence of learning (e.g., see Section 1.3; Barrie et al., 2012). selected because they can be used to assess program-level Some assessments are specific to single assignments within learning outcomes that demonstrate learning at relational or one course and others reflect learning across courses (i.e., extended abstract levels. The later an assessment occurs within portfolios and capstone projects). Keeping the principles a program, the closer to extended abstract levels students are in mind makes decisions about appropriate assessment expected to reach. tasks much easier. Various design criteria are important. For When you are choosing assessment tasks, bear in mind the example, calling an assessment tool a “portfolio” is hardly principles introduced in Section 1. The need for validity helps enough; it must be designed with the appropriate content narrow the range of choices – ask yourself, would this particular and complexity. The portfolio task must be well designed and assessment

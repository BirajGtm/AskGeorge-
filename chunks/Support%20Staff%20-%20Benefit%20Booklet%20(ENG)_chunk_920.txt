maximum of 130 working days. Once these days have been used, the remainder of the 130 working days allowed in a plan year will be paid at 75% of your regular base earnings. Upon retirement, layoff or termination of employment, unused days banked in your name shall be cancelled and shall be of no effect. After you have used the 130 working days of STD benefits, which are available in one plan year (together with any extensions available, if any, pursuant to the ''Accumulative Sick Leave Credits'' specified below), benefits may be provided under the Long Term Disability Insurance Plan, underwritten by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. The full cost of all Short Term Disability benefits is paid by the College.

The dollar amount of any cash benefit to be paid in accordance with the relevant conditions established by the College will be based on salary at December 31, 1977 or in the case of some former public servants retiring prior to December 31, 1977, the date of retirement.

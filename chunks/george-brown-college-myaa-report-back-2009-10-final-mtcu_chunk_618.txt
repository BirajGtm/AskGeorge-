In addition to our recruitment and international partnership work, other international activities have also been present with varying degrees of emphasis and investment, including study/work abroad, aid and development work abroad, faculty development (including global understanding and cross-cultural pedagogical skills), and contract training abroad. The new international strategy launched this year will enable GBC to focus greater attention on all these elements and become a much more internationalized institute over the next five years. The college’s internationalization strategy builds on traditional strength and benefits to the college (such as financial outcomes) with an increased academic focus on building the skills and competencies that students need for successful employment in a diverse society. This increased student focus requires the development of an “academic cluster” of international related capabilities: (1) more student work/study placements abroad (2) faculty with international knowledge and skills and (3) a more globalized curriculum. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 18 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Examples of activities launched as a result of the new internationalization development process: • Established research/analysis matrix of countries to ensure properly targeted recruiting and other investments • Development of innovative joint programming with traditional source countries: for example, the first cohort of students from the Shanghai Urban Management College (SUMC) will begin classes at GBC in September 2010 as a part of a partnership agreement established in 2007 that allows for the articulation of credentials between SUMC and GBC in the field of Construction Management • New administrative position “Manager International Programs and Partnerships” to optimize partner development initiatives in collaboration with academic divisions, overseas partners and the International Centre • Established leader in Ontario for providing study/work abroad opportunities o GBC is the top college in Ontario for

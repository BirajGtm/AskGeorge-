be calculated with a discount rate that is equal to either the College’s rate of borrowing or the rate of return on the plan assets. Pre-changeover GAAP required the discount rate to be equal to the yield on high quality corporate bonds. The College has chosen to discount these liabilities using its internal rate of borrowing. The change in the discount rate resulted in changes to the related liabilities and charges to net income as described in the tables above. 3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY a) On April 1, 2012, the College adopted Public Accounting Standards PS 1201 - Financial Statement Presentation, PS 3450 - Financial Instruments and PS 2601 – Foreign Currency Translation. The standards were adopted prospectively from the date of adoption. The new standards provide revised guidance in the general presentation of financial statements, comprehensive requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and foreign currency transactions. In addition, on April 1, 2012 the College early adopted an amendment to PS 3450 – Financial Instruments that would otherwise be effective for year-ends beginning on or after March 1, 2013. This amendment provides guidance on the classification of investment income on externally restricted assets. Under PS 3450, all financial instruments, including derivatives, are included on the statement of financial position and are measured either at fair value or amortized cost based on the characteristics of the instrument and the College’s accounting policy choices (see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies). There were no adjustments to the previously reported figures upon adoption of these sections. 15 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2013 3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY (continued) b) During the year, the College changed its accounting policy for its 50% interest in GBSP Centre Corp. (see Note 4) to the modified equity method, as it provided more relevant information to users of the financial statements. Previously, the College had accounted for GBSP Centre Corp. using the proportionate consolidation method. The change has been applied retroactively and prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. The effects of this change are as follows: Balance at April 1, 2011 as PSAB Transitional GBSP April 1, 2011, previously reported Adjustments (Note 2) Adjustments restated Assets $ 417,813,825 $ - $ (1,394,249) $ 416,419,576 Liabilities 276,269,280 7,530,708 (1,394,249) 2 82,405,739 Net Assets $ 141,544,545 $ (7,530,708) $ - $ 134,013,837 Balance at March 31, 2012 PSAB Transitional GBSP March 31, 2012, as previously reported Adjustments (Note 2) Adjustments restated Assets $ 469,555,570 $ - $ (1,420,442) $ 468,135,128 Liabilities 302,969,025 6,596,853 (1,420,442) $ 308,145,436 Net Assets $ 166,586,545 $ (6,596,853) $ - $ 159,989,692 - Revenue $ 279,441,793 $ - $ (1,492,208) $ 277,949,785 Expenditures 255,519,496 (933,855) (1,492,208) 2 53,093,533 Excess of revenue over expenditures $ 23,922,297 $ 933,855 $ - $ 24,856,252 The impact of the accounting policy change on the statement of cash flows for the year-ended March 31, 2012 can be seen in Note 4. 4.

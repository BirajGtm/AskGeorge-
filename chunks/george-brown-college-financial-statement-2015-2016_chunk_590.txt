The College made contributions to the Plan and its associated retirement compensation arrangement of $15,696 (2015 - $15,225) which has been included in salaries and benefits in the statement of operations. Post-employment benefits The College extends post employment life insurance, health and dental benefits to certain employee groups subsequent to their retirement. The College recognizes these benefits as they are earned during the employees’ tenure of service. The College also provide continuation of medical and dental benefits to certain employee groups while receiving long-term disability benefits. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council. The major actuarial assumptions employed for the valuation are as follows: (a) Discount rate The present value of employee future benefits as at March 31, 2016 was determined using a discount rate of 1.70% (2015 – 1.60%), while the 2016 period expense was calculated using a discount rate 1.60% (2015 – 2.70%). (b) Hospital and other medical Hospital and other medical costs were assumed to increase at 4.00% per annum (2015 – 4.00%). Medical premium increases were assumed to increase at 7.50% per annum in 2014 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.00% in 2034. (c) Drug costs Drug costs increases were assumed to increase at a 9% per annum in 2014 and decrease proportionately thereafter to an ultimate rate of 4.00% in 2034. (d) Dental costs Dental costs were assumed to increase at 4.00% per annum (2015 – 4.00%). 16 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2016 ($ amounts are in thousands) 8.

Eligible employees, after 10 years of service, are entitled to receive 50% of their accumulated sick leave credit on termination or retirement to a maximum of 6 months’ salary. The program to accumulate sick leave credits ceased for employees hired after March 31, 1991. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council. Non-Vesting Sick Leave The College allocates to certain employee groups a specified number of days each year for use as paid absences in the event of illness or injury. These days do not vest and are available immediately. Employees are permitted to accumulate their unused allocation each year, up to the allowable maximum provided in their employment agreements. Accumulated days may be used in future years to the extent that the employees’ illness or injury exceeds the current year’s allocation of days. Sick days are paid out at the salary in effect at the time of usage. The related benefit liability was determined by an actuarial valuation study commissioned by the College Employer Council.

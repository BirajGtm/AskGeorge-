GBC has grown exponentially over the past 5 years, and we are now at full capacity. We have continued to add classroom space by renovating existing buildings (200 King; 300 Adelaide), and taken on new space in adjacent properties (210 King; the theatres at Market Square).Space constraints are our only impediment to growing further to meet demand. GBC has made significant investments to-date in its ongoing quest for teaching and learning excellence and in outreach strategies geared at under-represented groups. GBC conducts in-depth reviews of about a dozen of programs every year using Program Review, a collaborative process of on-going academic self-assessment and evaluation to ensure programs remain relevant. GBC also conducts an environmental scan which outlines major socio-economic and political trends that will influence the kinds of students we will be educating over the next 5-10 years, their place in the economy, and the industries/sectors we will be engaging. The aim of the environmental scan is to assist the college with strategic planning and to assess GBC’s position within the current environment and opportunities for further development. On the outreach front, there has been an increase in outreach to Aboriginal students in the college and to the Aboriginal community to encourage pursuing post-secondary education. Directed supports for Aboriginal students have been implemented to increase their persistence and successful program completion. A more interactive and responsive Communications curriculum is now in place at the foundational and college level. Pathways and comparisons among Communications courses in academic upgrading, ESL, and post-secondary programs have been mapped to ensure smooth transitions and minimal repetition. Measures to increase students’ achievement of goals and reduce time in the Academic Upgrading program have been implemented. Direct teaching of employability skills has been added to the Augmented Education programs. 2) Under-Represented Students: Students with Disabilities*, First Generation* and Aboriginal* *DEFINITION: Students with disabilities is the total number of students with disabilities (excluding apprentices) registered with the Office for Students with Disabilities and reported in Table 1 of the institutions' annual report to the Ministry for the Accessibility Fund for Students with Disabilities Fund (AFSD). *DEFINITION: First Generation is a student whose parent(s)/guardian(s) has/have not attended a postsecondary institution.

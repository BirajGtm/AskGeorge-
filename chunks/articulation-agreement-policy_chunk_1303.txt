V15/12/15 Articulation Agreement Policy SCOPE Articulation agreements between George Brown College and secondary schools (which may be dual credit initiatives, a specific memorandum of understanding or a similar document), internal articulations between George Brown College programs, and external articulations between George Brown College and accredited post-secondary institutions at the provincial and national level. This policy excludes international articulation agreements. DEFINITIONS This list includes an explanation of terms and abbreviations used within, or applicable to, this Articulation Agreement Policy. Word/Term Definition Advanced Standing Advanced Standing refers to credits granted upon admission that enable direct entry to the second, or higher, semester. Advanced standing grades are granted to students applying to a semester of study other than the entry level semester and are recorded on the student record as AS and not included in GPA calculations. Articulation Articulation is a broad term that relates to various methods whereby students can receive transfer credit for specific course work taken previously in a different program or a different institution. Through the process of articulation, institutions assess courses offered at other institutions to determine whether to grant course credit toward their own programs or credentials. Articulation Agreement An articulation agreement is an official agreement between two (bilateral) or more (multilateral) institutions- a secondary school, college or university- that authorizes studies undertaken in specific programs at one institution to be credited toward specific programs at another institution. Articulation agreements may apply to programs within an institution as well as to external accredited partners at the local, provincial and national level. Block Credits A group of courses taken at one institution which are considered equivalent to a group of courses at another institution. This leads to admission to a semester higher than semester one. Block Transfer Block transfer refers to advanced standing for a group of credits or courses at one institution based on their equivalence to a defined set of course or program learning outcomes at another institution. Block transfer enables direct entry to the second, or higher, semester.

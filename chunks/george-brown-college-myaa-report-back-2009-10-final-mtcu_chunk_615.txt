accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. In addition, George Brown may, if desired, identify below any factors, such as program mix, that affected credit transfer graduate survey outcomes. We are currently working on articulations agreements with the University of Toronto for our General Arts and Science program and Dental Hygiene. We are following-up with some potential Universities to continue the pathway from Practical Nursing to B.Sc.N. We are also in the process of establishing a degree completion articulation with Bishops University in Quebec and expanding articulations with Athabasca University. Additionally we have a partnership agreement to create a pathway in from Katimavik so successful participants can get academic credit for some of that work if they subsequently go to GBC. In order to track students in the post-secondary system it is important that we assign students a provincial postsecondary education number similar to what has been done for the elementary and secondary panel. Also the movement from college to university in the GTA area is restricted by the limited capacity of the local universities. In some cases we have excellent articulation agreements but the university does not have the capacity to accommodate all eligible students. Results from the Graduate KPI survey indicate that many of our graduates want to stay in the GTA. Our college also has limited capacity to accommodate college transfer students for the same reason. “In 2007-08, about 26% of GBC graduates were enrolled in a college or university six months after graduation. Of this, 55% returned to GBC, 11% went to Ryerson, 8% to York University, and the rest to other institutions. In 2008-09, about 22% of GBC graduates were enrolled in a college or university. Of this, 51% returned to GBC, 14% went to Ryerson, 8% to York University, and the rest to other institutions.” ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 12 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities 6) Class Size • Please provide the number and percentage of all first-year classes (all programs) at George Brown in 2009-10 that were: Class Size Number of Classes Percentage of Total Classes Less than 30 students 715 42% 30 to 60 students 810 47% 61 to 100 students 151 9% 101 to 250 students 45 2% 251 or more students 0 0 Total 1,721 100% ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 13 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities • Please provide one or more examples in the space provided below of a promising practice that George Brown used during 2009-10 regarding class size. A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. George Brown has adopted a policy of capping the size of both the foundational Communications course (Skills for College English) and the standard first semester Communications course (College English) to maximize the effectiveness of the learning experiences in those courses across the College. Skills for College English is limited to 25 students per class (with a 10% margin creating a hard cap of 28) and

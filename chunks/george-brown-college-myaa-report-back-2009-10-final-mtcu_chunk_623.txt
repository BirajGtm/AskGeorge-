completed construction of the new Integrated Student Service Centre at the St James campus. The staffing model is unique in that students can handle all of these initial inquiries with one staff member. The Centre has an enhanced line management system to help students move through the process efficiently and during peak periods houses additional services such as the Canada Student Loan program. The focus is on the various services to help students get started. This service delivery model has been visited by more than 20 delegations as a Canadian best practice site and parts of the model have been adopted by six Ontario colleges. Athletics Facilities: In 2009-10, Phase 2 of 3 is underway to renovate the Athletics Facilities in an effort to modernize, expand and enhance. Phase 2 will introduce spectator seating, much needed storage for athletics equipment, new universal washrooms for accessibility purposes, upgrades to lighting and overall look and feel of the facility as well as a new Student Success area for students and particularly, varsity athletes, to study, review games, meet with coaches and student success staff and to provide an area to gather. Planning is complete for Phase 3 to expand double the size of the weight and cardio centre and to introduce two studio spaces as well as a spinning room. This expansion will allow for programming to be increased fourfold.

2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities • Please provide one or more examples in the space provided below of a promising practice that George Brown used during 2009-10 regarding class size. A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. George Brown has adopted a policy of capping the size of both the foundational Communications course (Skills for College English) and the standard first semester Communications course (College English) to maximize the effectiveness of the learning experiences in those courses across the College. Skills for College English is limited to 25 students per class (with a 10% margin creating a hard cap of 28) and College English is capped at 35 students per class (with a 10% margin creating a hard cap of 39.). The Pre-Health, Pre-Community Services, and Pre-Business programs were moved to a cohort model, ensuring consistent class size across a range of subjects and making it easier for students to form relationships for study groups and mutual support. This enabled us to introduce student success initiatives that are dependent on the students knowing one another and being able to work together effectively in small student-led groups. One hour was added to three hour classes in first year Business Math and Remedial Math. The hour is allocated to a tutorial in which students work individually and in teams on problem solving related to class content. The scheduling of the classes are 2+2 per week. The feedback from the students has been positive and they indicate they are more confident in their abilities. Data is from one year only so far. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 14 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities 7) Online Learning • A survey was conducted in 2010 to develop a stronger understanding of online activity in the postsecondary system.

A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. This academic year, 2010, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences will offer close to 50 sections of online delivery in each of the fall and winter semesters. Ten new online courses have been added since spring 2007, with several more in the development stage. With this expansion, there have been a number of initiatives that have occurred; 1. Introduction of a coordinator to work with teachers who are teaching online, 2. Introduction by the Academic Excellence department of guidelines for developing an online course, 3. WebCT forum for online teachers to meet and discuss issues regarding online delivery, 4. Development and delivery of online orientation for students enrolled in online

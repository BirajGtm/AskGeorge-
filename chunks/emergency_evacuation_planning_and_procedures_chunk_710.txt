General Information Everyone at George Brown College has a responsibility to follow the college’s emergency procedures should an emergency such as fire, flooding, chemical spill, building collapse, etc. occur. An important part of this responsibility is committing to “Take 5 for Safety” at the beginning of every meeting and every class to heighten everyone’s awareness of safety everywhere on campus. An equally important part is ensuring that you understand the college’s established emergency procedures as outlined in this manual so that you know what to do should evacuation or lockdown be necessary.

Take 5 for Safety The Take 5 for Safety campaign has been designed to maintain awareness of safety information everywhere on our St. James, Casa Loma, Waterfront and Ryerson campuses. It brings emergency preparedness to the forefront at the beginning of every class and every meeting. The components of Take 5 for Safety include  identifying exit routes and designated waiting areas.  reviewing evacuation and lockdown procedures.  providing emergency contact information.  checking for and reporting any hazards. Take 5 for Safety information specific to each building is presented on the following pages. It mirrors the posters found throughout each building.

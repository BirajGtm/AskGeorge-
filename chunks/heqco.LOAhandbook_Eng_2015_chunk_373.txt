As outlined in the first two sections of the handbook, assessment of learning outcomes is a process of “making our expectations explicit and public; setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning quality; systematically gathering, analysing, and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and standards; and using the resulting information to document, explain, and improve performance” (Angelo, 1995, p. 7). Well-articulated program-level assessment plans must identify program-level learning outcomes, the assessments used to measure that achievement and a plan for using this information for program enhancement. The process is most effective when undertaken by a team made up of instructors, program coordinators, students and educational developers. Program-level assessment plans aim to highlight the characteristics of successful programs and note areas for improvement. Substantial programs, effective leadership and administrative support are essential throughout the planning and implementation process (see Section 3). 19 KROWEMARF DNA WEIVREVO — 1 NOITCES We have conceptualized the assessment of program-level learning outcomes as a four-stage cycle: Four-Stage Cycle for the Assessment of Program-Level Learning Outcomes STAGE 1 STAGE 2 Identify Expectations Map Assessment Tasks STAGE 4 STAGE 3 Make Program Gather and Analyze FIGURE 5 Improvements Assessment Results STAGE 1: IDENTIFY EXPECTATIONS OF PROGRAM-LEVEL LEARNING OUTCOMES The first step in program assessment is to articulate clearly what you expect students to learn and how you expect them to demonstrate this learning by the time they reach the end of the program. Clearly defined expectations are important because they form the basis for future decisions about the appropriate assessment types to measure the achievement of those outcomes. Clarifying your program-level learning outcomes will also help you to ensure that learning experiences and assessments are focused on the most important skills, ideas, attitudes and values of the discipline or profession. Recent literature suggests that many students are not able to identify or articulate the learning outcomes that they have achieved; greater clarity may help graduates better articulate their skills and attributes to future employers (Barrie et al., 2009; Martini & Clare, 2014). It is therefore important to communicate learning outcomes to students throughout their program of study. There are a number of factors worth considering when identifying learning outcomes (Figure 6), such as students’ knowledge prior to entering a program; the curriculum; types of teaching and learning techniques they will experience within the program; possible methods of assessment; and expectations from external bodies, including government agencies and professional associations. It is often helpful for all instructors in the program to contribute to the development and review of program-level learning outcomes to ensure that essential learning outcomes are

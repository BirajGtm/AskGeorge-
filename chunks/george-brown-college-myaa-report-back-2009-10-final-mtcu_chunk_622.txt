A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. Student Experience Research Project: In 2009-10, George Brown College invested in the Student Experience research phase to better understand a) levels of student satisfaction and engagement and b) student preference for future investment in the Student Experience. The findings will form the basis for a Student Experience Strategic Plan being developed in 2010-11. In 2009-10, several facilities activities assisted to improve the learning environment. Several classrooms at various campus locations were added. The ASL instruction lab was renovated to enhance the space and improve A/V equipment; the Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts bake labs were totally renovated and had new updated equipment installed, plus the space was air conditioned for improved comfort; the Student Service Centre was expanded and enhanced and a new Career Centre was opened at 200 King; a new International and Immigrant Education Centre advising space was created at 160 Kendal serving the Casa Loma campus; the first phase of an energy improvement project was completed at 300 Adelaide to reduce the energy intensity in that area; the 200 King lower level expanded Library Learning Commons was opened in early 2010. This is to improve availability of student study, research and group activity spaces at the St. James campus. Student Service Centre In 2009-10, the College completed construction of the new Integrated Student Service Centre at the St James campus. The staffing model is unique in that students can handle all of these initial inquiries with one staff member. The Centre has an enhanced line management system to help students move through the process efficiently and during peak periods houses additional services such as the Canada Student Loan program. The focus is on the various services to help students get started. This service delivery model has been visited by more than 20 delegations as a Canadian best practice site and parts of the model have been adopted by six Ontario colleges. Athletics Facilities: In 2009-10, Phase 2 of 3 is underway to renovate the Athletics Facilities in an effort to modernize, expand and enhance.

In 2010, we plan to engage administrative staff in the retreat which will bring the total staff participation in this important event to 90. In addition, 60 faculty each semester engage in the “Learning Squares” program. Faculty are divided into groups of four (from different Divisions and with different degrees of experience). During the semester, each faculty member agrees to invite the other three members of their “square” to observe one of their classes. At the end of the semester, the group of four reconvenes and each member provides verbal self-reflective feedback to the rest of the group. As an example, one faculty member might say, “As a result of observing the classes that I was invited to attend, I learned that I my teaching practice is strong in the area of ….. and that I could improve my ability to ….” The feedback from faculty was very positive and many of the “squares” continued voluntarily into the next semester. The benefits of this program are many including the acquisition of teaching strategies, changing the classroom from a private space with a closed door to a more public space, helping faculty see firsthand that the issues they face in the classroom are cross divisional and departmental boundaries and creating a sense that we are all learning about teaching and learning together. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 26 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities 12) Graduation Rate Per the KPI results reported in 2009-10 the graduation rate at George Brown = 73.3% • Please provide one or more example in the space provided below of a promising practice that George Brown used during 2009-10 related to the achievement of the graduation rate. A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. Student success initiatives were introduced and strengthened for the preparatory programs. These initiatives provided opportunities for students to practice material they were learning in their regular classes, clarify concepts they did not understand and improve their study skills. A record number of students were able to take advantage of articulation agreements to move into diploma programs at the college as well as to be accepted from the general applicant pool because they were able to meet the academic qualifications. The introduction of new teaching methods and revised curriculum in Academic Upgrading is designed to reduce students’ time in the program and increase their readiness for future study, with an emphasis on Math and English skills. As a student success and peer tutoring initiative, GBC developed and opened two Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) Centres where peer advisors work together with students to create and share strategies for learning. GBC showed a KPI student satisfaction increase of 6% for peer tutoring. Career Services developed and launched Career Start - a self serve on-line career course with multi-media applications. In partnership with different divisions, Career Start is embedded into the student curriculum in order to assist students with lifelong career development skills. ______________________________________________________________________________________________

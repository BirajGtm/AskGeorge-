Significant accounting policies: These consolidated financial statements are the representations of management and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting standards for not-for-profit organizations. The significant accounting policies are as follows: (a) (i) Basis of accounting: The College’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the College and the College’s 50% interest in the GBSP Centre Corp. joint venture. All material inter-entity transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. (ii) Student organizations These financial statements do not reflect the assets, liabilities and the results of operations of the various student organizations. (b) Revenue recognition: The College follows the deferral method of accounting for restricted contributions. Operating grants are recorded as revenue in the period to which they relate. Grants earned but not received at the end of an accounting period are accrued. Where a portion of a grant relates to a future period, it is deferred and recognized in that subsequent period. Unrestricted contributions are recognized as revenue when received or receivable, if the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured. Externally restricted contributions, other than endowment contributions, are recognized as revenue in the year in which the related expenses are incurred. Contributions restricted for the purchase of capital assets are deferred and amortized into revenue on

and begins discussions on feasibility and willingness to proceed. Appendix 2 contains a useful checklist of feasibility considerations. The Notice of Intent to Articulate (Appendix 3) documents the planning process and is a useful tracking tool for audit purposes. This sets the parameters of the partnership and determines the scope of the articulation and the nature of the more detailed work ahead. The timeframes for these discussions vary considerably based on the nature and needs of the partners. At this step, institutions should: 1.1 Identify names/credentials of the articulating programs 1.2 Determine the type of articulation sought (course to course or block-semester or year; bilateral or multilateral) 1.3 Confirm interests and priorities (the suitability- branding, positioning, future opportunities) of the partnering program/institution(s) 1.4 Conduct initial feasibility review of the proposed articulation agreement in terms of available resources, overall benefit to George Brown College and employment opportunities for students and graduates 1.5 Begin formative consultations with appropriate George Brown College departments to determine and assess the potential impact of the proposed articulation on, for example, facilities, faculty, program enrolment, revenue or additional cost, and other college programs 1.6 File Notice of Intent to Articulate (Appendix 3) with the Divisional Dean of the programs under consideration for signed approval to proceed Step 2 Letter of Intent To provide clarity of roles and maintain accountability, a Letter of Intent signed and dated by the designated signatory of the potential partners is suggested at this juncture. The information listed in the Letter of Intent provides clarity for the more detailed program mapping and determination of transfer credits for the new Articulation Agreement Policy articulated program pathway. A sample Letter of Intent is attached as Appendix 4. Considerations in the development of the Letter of Intent include but are not limited to the following: 2.1 Consultation with partnering institution(s) (department/program if internal) to outline and confirm the primary outcomes of the agreement such as pathway category, credential awarded, type of transfer credit- course to course, block-, eligibility criteria and implementation timelines 2.2 Identification of faculty responsible for the assessment of course transfer credit and the development of the new program pathways specific to the articulation agreement proposed 2.3 Timelines for the development, signing and launch of the Articulation Agreement 2.4 Processes for review, revision, and/or termination including designate signatures 2.5 Signing, communication and retention of the Letter of Intent as required by GBC program department and the partnering institution Step 3 Memorandum of Understanding 3.1 Determine Transfer Credits and Develop Program Maps The most important component of any articulation agreement is equivalency determination and the program mapping which defines the new opportunities provided by the articulated program pathways. The process requires dialogue and collaboration between the program partners to ensure pertinent information for program development, determination of transfer credit/equivalency and gap analysis is available, complete and current. As a sending college, George Brown supplies course outlines and program maps for review by the receiving institution to determine which courses will be considered equivalent in content and granted transfer credit. As a receiving institution, George Brown evaluates the

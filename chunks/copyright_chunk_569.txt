These procedures must be used to ensure compliance to existing copyright laws as it relates to copying, reproducing and printing royalty-protected and restricted material. Fair Dealing: is often mentioned to ensure that what is reproduced from the copyrighted work is fair. It is an exception in the Copyright Act to allow other people's copyright protected material to be used for the purpose of research, private study, education, satire, parody, criticism, review or news reporting, as long as what is used falls below the 10% content allowed and what is deemed fair. Copyright Clearance: means that Xerox must obtain permission from the copyright holder to use the material. This permission is required for copyright material equal or above the 10% content allowed to a maximum of 20%. Xerox: is the onsite partner that manages all copyright clearance requests for course packs for the College. Xerox is located in all three George Brown College campuses. Procedures • A detailed bibliography must be provided with the draft course pack request. An audit will be performed to evaluate content limits and identify clearance requirements • The bibliography will also be used for royalty payments to Access Copyright • Xerox will apply and obtain permission and appropriate clearance for the work to be printed.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: These financial statements are the representations of management and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards for government not-for-profit organizations, including the 4200 series of standards, as issued by Public Sector Accounting Board (“PSAB for Government NPOs”). The significant accounting policies are as follows: a) Revenue recognition: The College follows the deferral method of accounting for contributions, which include donations and government grants. Operating grants are recorded as revenue in the period to which they relate. Grants earned but not received at the end of an accounting period are accrued. Where a portion of a grant relates to a future period, it is deferred and recognized in that subsequent period. Unrestricted contributions are recognized as revenue when received or receivable, if the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured. Externally restricted contributions, other than endowment contributions, are recognized as revenue in the year in which the related expenses are incurred. Contributions externally restricted for the purchase of capital assets are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis, at a rate corresponding with the amortization rate for the related capital assets. Endowment contributions are recognized as direct increases in endowment net assets. Restricted income is recognized as revenue in the year in which the related expenses are incurred. Unrestricted income is recognized

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION George Brown College Emergency Management Plan George Brown College Crisis Communications Plan George Brown College Fire Plans (specific to each building) 3 APPENDIX A LOCKDOWN PROCEDURES Roles and Responsibilities:  The lockdown call will be made by the Security team, acting on their own judgement and/or direction from the college’s Public Safety and Security Division or from Toronto Police Services.  Once a lockdown has been called and Toronto Police are on scene, the responsibility for dealing with the active threat belongs to Toronto Police Services. The building will be under their control, as they seek to identify the threat, assess the best approach to dealing with it, neutralize the threat, and declare the situation safe. The Police will determine whether the lockdown will end with an “all clear” signal, or whether they will go room by room to bring occupants safely out and ensure there are no residual threats.  Once a lockdown has been called, the Security personnel in that building have a particular responsibility to coordinate with and assist Toronto Police Services in their response, while taking due care to protect themselves and the safety of those other people immediately around them.  Once a lockdown has been initiated, Public Safety and Security will engage the college’s Emergency Management Plan and initiate Incident Command. The Emergency Operations Centre will coordinate further communication during and after the lockdown, and will coordinate the identification, marshalling and delivery of required college support services to those affected.

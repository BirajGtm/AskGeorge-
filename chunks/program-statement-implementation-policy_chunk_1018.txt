Program Statement Implementation Policy Our centre has a program statement that is consistent with the Minister’s policy statement on programming and pedagogy referred to in How Does Learning Happen? The program statement reflects the view of the child as being competent, capable, curious and rich in potential. Our program statement describes the goals that guide our program for children and the approaches that will be implemented in the program. • Staff, students and volunteers are required to implement the approaches outlined in the program statement when they are applicable. • It is expected that the approaches used by educators for key elements of the program be implemented on an on-going basis e.g. interacting with a child in a positive and responsive manner • Our program uses pedagogical documentation to illustrate how the approaches are being implemented into the program. This will provide evidence that the approaches in the program statement are being implemented when they cannot be observed e.g. learning stories, On-Line Documentation Resource • Our program statement outlines specific strategies for implementation all goals areas and program expectations • Our daily practices, program plans and playroom environments are aligned to the Program Statement and serve as evidence of implementation Our program statement is aligned with the municipal quality assurance mechanisms and measures from Toronto Children’s Services.

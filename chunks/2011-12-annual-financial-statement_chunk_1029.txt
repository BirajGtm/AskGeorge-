Pension plan costs: A majority of the College’s employees are members of the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Pension plan (the “Plan”), which is a multi-employer jointly sponsored defined benefit plan for eligible employees of public colleges and related employers in Ontario. The College makes contributions to the Plan equal to those of the employees. Contributions rates are set by the Plan’s governors to ensure the long term viability of the Plan. Any pension surplus or deficit is a joint responsibility of the members and employers and may affect future contribution rates. The College does not recognize any share of the Plan’s pension surplus or deficit as insufficient information is available to identify the College’s share of the underlying pension assets and liabilities. The most recent actuarial valuation filled with pension regulators as at January 1, 2012 indicated an actuarial surplus of $154 million, The College made contributions to the Plan and its associated retirement compensation arrangement of $11,504,000 (2011 - $11,381,000) which has been included in the statement of operations. 10.

YES • If yes, please indicate in the space below the methodology used to inform George Brown’s academic space utilization planning process: GBC uses a number of interrelated processes. An accurate room inventory (including capacities and whether the scheduling of the room is under control of the Registrar or a dedicated divisional owner) is maintained in the Student Information System. Medium term projections are made and updated to identify gross space requirements of planned enrolments. Scheduled space utilization by term is calculated for classrooms and labs and totalled for each building and campus. Underutilized rooms are analysed annually for refurbishment/upgrade requirements. Space utilization by program in each term is calculated and program-level costs for space used are reported by term. Space- usage analysis is brought into the periodic college-wide Program Portfolio Analysis reviews, and space efficiency of programs is one of the metrics that is considered when

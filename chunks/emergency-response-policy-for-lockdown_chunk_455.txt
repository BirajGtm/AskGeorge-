The situation will likely be tense, and individuals should support and encourage each other.  All cell and smartphones should be placed in silent mode, so as not to signal room occupancy should a call or message be received.  Use the GBC app to receive status updates on your smartphone, or monitor the georgebrown.ca website which will have banner update communications on it.

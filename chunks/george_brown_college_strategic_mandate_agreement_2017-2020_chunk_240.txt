teaching and learning methodologies. The College’s facility condition index was last calculated to be close to the provincial average of 15%, or poor. The College has entered into two energy service company arrangements in recent years, using the cash flow from energy savings to fund some of the systems renewal required, but that source of funding is quite limited and cannot address the larger deferred maintenance backlog. This issue is not critical today, but collaborative answers must be found with the Ministry in the medium term.  36 Program Sustainability While the College believes deeply in its access agenda, its ability to offer some niche access programs is becoming increasingly constrained because of a lack of adequate operating funding. This financial sustainability challenge is particularly acute for programs that serve marginalized populations and the deaf and hard of hearing community. APPENDIX – FOR INTERNAL REFERENCE ONLY Projected Weighted Funding Units and Corridor Midpoint (2020-21) Colleges are asked to report their projected Weighted Funding (WFUs) for 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 and provide the resulting projected midpoint. As given in the College Funding Formula Technical Manual, the midpoint is calculated based on the “three-year average, two-year slip”, the average of three years of enrolment two years prior to the funding year. In 2020-21, the 2019-20 level of WFUs are expected to be the basis of each college’s initial midpoint in the corridor funding model.

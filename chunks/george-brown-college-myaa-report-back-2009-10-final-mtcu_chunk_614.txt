Refer to the next page NOTE: The Ministry recognizes that this is a census survey in which the response rate is approximately 66%. The Ministry also recognizes that this only captures college graduates who have transferred within 6 months of graduation and is not the complete picture of college-university transfer students.

The Ministry is developing long-term indicators for credit transfer in consultation with the sector. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 11 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities • Please provide one or more example in the space provided below of a promising practice that George Brown used during 2009-10 to develop and enhance credit transfer. A promising practice could be a strategy, transfer pathway (i.e. transfer policies, specifically defined credits or a defined entry point, new or expanded agreements), change to student supports or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. In addition, George Brown may, if desired, identify below any factors, such as program mix, that affected credit transfer graduate survey outcomes. We are currently working on articulations agreements with the University of Toronto for our General Arts and Science program and Dental Hygiene. We are following-up with some potential Universities to continue the pathway from Practical Nursing to B.Sc.N. We are also in the process of establishing a degree completion articulation with Bishops University in Quebec and expanding articulations with Athabasca University. Additionally we have a partnership agreement to create a pathway in from Katimavik so successful participants can get academic credit for some of that work if they subsequently go to GBC.

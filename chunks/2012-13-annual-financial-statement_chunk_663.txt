Retirement Benefits. Business combinations: The College elected to not retroactively apply the provisions PS 2510 â€“ Additional Areas of Consolidation to periods prior to the date of transition to PSAB for Government NPOs. As such, assets, liabilities and net assets have not been restated that may have been required if the provisions of PS 2510 had been applied retroactively. Mandatory exemptions Estimates: The estimates previously made by the College under pre-changeover Canadian GAAP were not revised for the application of PSAB for Government NPOs except where necessary to reflect any difference in accounting policy or where there was objective evidence that those estimates were in error. As a result the College has not used hindsight to revise estimates. Reconciliation of net assets and excess of revenue over expenses: In preparing these financial statements, management has amended certain accounting policies previously applied in the pre-changeover Canadian GAAP financial statements to comply with PSAB for Government NPOs. The comparative figures for March 31, 2012 were restated to reflect these adjustments. The following reconciliations and explanatory notes provide a description of the effect of the transition from pre-changeover Canadian GAAP to PSAB for Government NPOs on net assets and excess of revenues over expenses: 12 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2013 2.

The College is exposed to this risk relating to its cash, investments, grants receivable, accounts receivable, and receivable from George Brown College Foundation. The College holds its cash accounts with a federally regulated chartered bank who is insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the event of default, the College’s cash accounts are insured up to $100 (2014 - $100). The College’s investment policy operates within the constraints of the investment guidelines issued by the MTCU and puts limits on the bond portfolio including portfolio composition limits, issuer type limits, bond quality limits, aggregate issuer limits, corporate sector limits and general guidelines for geographic exposure. All fixed income portfolios are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management during the year. The guidelines permit the College’s funds to be invested in bonds issued by the Government of Canada, a Canadian province or a Canadian municipality having a rating of A or better, or corporate investments having a rating of AAA (high) or better. Accounts receivable is primarily due from students, government, and other large corporations. Credit risk is mitigated by the highly diversified nature of the student population. The College measures its exposure to credit risk based on how long the amounts have been outstanding. An impairment allowance is set up based on the College’s historical experience regarding collections. The amounts outstanding at year end were as follows: Past Due 31 - 60 61 - 90 91 - 120 Over 121 Total Current days days days days Government receivable $ 1,041 $ 1,041 Student receivable 7 ,455 1,969 4 51 1,009 987 3,039 Other receivable 11,640 10,230 1 82 164 627 437 Gross receivable 20,136 13,240 6 33 1,173 1,614 3,476 Less: impairment allowances (4,019) (402) (805) (2,812) Net receivable $ 16,117 $ 13,240 $ 633 $ 771 $ 809 $ 664 There have been no significant changes from the previous year in the exposure to risk or policies, procedures and methods used to measure the risk.

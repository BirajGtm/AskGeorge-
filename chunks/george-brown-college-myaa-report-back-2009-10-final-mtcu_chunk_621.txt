utilization planning process: GBC uses a number of interrelated processes. An accurate room inventory (including capacities and whether the scheduling of the room is under control of the Registrar or a dedicated divisional owner) is maintained in the Student Information System. Medium term projections are made and updated to identify gross space requirements of planned enrolments. Scheduled space utilization by term is calculated for classrooms and labs and totalled for each building and campus. Underutilized rooms are analysed annually for refurbishment/upgrade requirements. Space utilization by program in each term is calculated and program-level costs for space used are reported by term. Space- usage analysis is brought into the periodic college-wide Program Portfolio Analysis reviews, and space efficiency of programs is one of the metrics that is considered when planning portfolio adjustments (expansion and contraction). • If yes, please provide one or more examples in the space provided below of a promising practice that George Brown used during 2009-10 to assess and optimize academic space utilization. A promising practice could be a strategy, initiative or program viewed by the institution to be an innovative practice, success story and/or key accomplishment that the institution would like to highlight. GBC operates on a decentralised model of program planning, in which the divisions do the forward planning of programming and enrolment. Over the past three years, work has progressed to define and integrate costs for space utilization by each program into the financial reporting system, to bring a clear cost signal to the responsible managers. Until this year, this costing has been done on a “shadow cost” basis; in 2009- 10, work is underway to assess the learning to date and identify the optimum way to weave space costing into our budgeting and control processes. Also in 2009-10, the college completed a five-year Portfolio Mix Strategy development process that included in-depth analysis of our programs’ space efficiency, including analysis of the delivery capacity locked up in the space currently used by the least efficient programs. Goals are being set for conversion of some of this space to higher-efficiency uses. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 22 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities 11) Student Satisfaction • Per the KPI results reported in 2009-10 the student satisfaction rate at George Brown for KPI Question #14 “Overall, your program is giving you knowledge and skills that will be useful in your future career” = 85.3% • Per the KPI results reported in 2009-10 the student satisfaction rate at George Brown for KPI Question #26 “The overall quality of the learning experiences in this program” = 77.5% • Per the KPI results reported in 2009-10 the student satisfaction rate at George Brown for KPI Question #44 “The overall quality of the facilities/resources in the college” = 60.1% • Per the KPI results reported in 2009-10 the student satisfaction rate at George Brown for KPI Question #45 “The overall quality of the services in the college” = 60.2% ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 23 FINAL July 16, 2010 Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities • Please provide one or more examples in the space provided

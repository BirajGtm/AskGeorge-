POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND COMPENSATED ABSENCES (continued) (b) Wage and salary escalation rates Academic full-time and academic partial load salaries were assumed to increase at a rate between 0% to 1.8% per annum. Support staff full-time salaries were assumed to increase at a rate between 0% to 1.75% per annum. The probability that the employee will use more sick days than the annual accrual and the excess number of sick days used are within ranges of 0% to 24% and 0 to 44.3 days respectively for age groups ranging from 20 and under to 65 and over in bands of 5 years. 8.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the College if a debtor fails to make payments of interest and principal when due. The College is exposed to this risk relating to its cash, investments, grants receivable, accounts receivable, and receivable from George Brown College Foundation. The College holds its cash accounts with a federally regulated chartered bank who is insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the event of default, the College’s cash accounts are insured up to $100 (2015 - $100). The College’s investment policy operates within the constraints of the investment guidelines issued by the MTCU and puts limits on the bond portfolio including portfolio composition limits, issuer type limits, bond quality limits, aggregate issuer limits, corporate sector limits and general guidelines for geographic exposure. All fixed income portfolios are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management during the year. The guidelines permit the College’s funds to be invested in bonds issued by the Government of Canada, a Canadian province or a Canadian municipality having a rating of A or better, or corporate investments having a rating of AAA (high) or better. Accounts receivable is primarily due from students, government, and other large corporations. Credit risk is mitigated by the highly diversified nature of the student population. 25 THE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE OF APPLIED ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY Notes to Financial Statements Year ended March 31, 2016 ($ amounts are in thousands) 21.

normal course of business, the College has entered into agreements that include indemnities in favour of third parties, such as student work placement agreements. These indemnification agreements may require the College to compensate counterparties for losses incurred by the counterparties as a result of breaches in representation and regulations or as a result of litigation claims or statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. The terms of these indemnities are not explicitly defined and the maximum amount of any potential reimbursement cannot be reasonably estimated. The nature of these indemnification agreements prevents the College from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum exposure due to the difficulties in assessing the amount of liability which stems from the unpredictability of future events and the unlimited coverage offered to counterparties. Historically, the College has not made any significant payments under such or similar indemnification agreements and therefore no amount has been recorded in the statement of financial position with respect to these agreements. 17.

Capital Management: The College considers its net assets, capital leases and deferred capital contributions as its capital. Net assets The College operations are reliant on revenues generated annually. The College has accumulated net assets to March 31, 2009 of approximately $106,301,000 (2008 - $89,780,000) which are presented in the statement of financial position as net assets. The majority of this amount relates to invested in capital assets which represent accumulated net assets which have been dedicated to the College’s capital asset acquisition and development. Another portion relates to internally restricted funds which represent financial commitments made by the Board towards those initiatives described in Note 11. A further portion represents financial resources which are subject to external restrictions. The College manages an endowment fund of approximately $7,496,000 (2008 - $5,737,000) with conditions stipulated in contribution agreements concerning the use of the funds and related income. The College has complied with the requirements of these restricted funds. Unrestricted net assets represent capital that may be utilized for general operations, a portion of which is retained as working capital. Capital leases The College capital management program also utilizes equipment financing which is comprised principally of capital lease borrowing arrangements described in Note 9. Deferred capital contributions Capital grants and capital donations are treated as deferred capital contributions and amortized over the life of the related capital assets. At March 31, 2009, the College was in compliance with all restrictions applicable to these funding sources. 19.
